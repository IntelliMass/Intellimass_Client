      "title": "A Survey of Machine and Deep Learning Methods for Internet of Things (IoT) Security",
      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one another with minimal human intervention. IoT is one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. However, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems have introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network and application security for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to effectively secure the IoT ecosystem. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned from laboratory novelty to practical machinery in several important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML methods and recent advances in DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can serve as potential future research directions.",

      "title": "A Comprehensive Survey on Internet of Things (IoT) Toward 5G Wireless Systems",
      "abstract": "Recently, wireless technologies have been growing actively all around the world. In the context of wireless technology, fifth-generation (5G) technology has become a most challenging and interesting topic in wireless research. This article provides an overview of the Internet of Things (IoT) in 5G wireless systems. IoT in the 5G system will be a game changer in the future generation. It will open a door for new wireless architecture and smart services. Recent cellular network LTE (4G) will not be sufficient and efficient to meet the demands of multiple device connectivity and high data rate, more bandwidth, low-latency quality of service (QoS), and low interference. To address these challenges, we consider 5G as the most promising technology. We provide a detailed overview of challenges and vision of various communication industries in 5G IoT systems. The different layers in 5G IoT systems are discussed in detail. This article provides a comprehensive review on emerging and enabling technologies related to the 5G system that enables IoT. We consider the technology drivers for 5G wireless technology, such as 5G new radio (NR), multiple-input\u2013multiple-output antenna with the beamformation technology, mm-wave commutation technology, heterogeneous networks (HetNets), the role of augmented reality (AR) in IoT, which are discussed in detail. We also provide a review on low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), security challenges, and its control measure in the 5G IoT scenario. This article introduces the role of AR in the 5G IoT scenario. This article also discusses the research gaps and future directions. The focus is also on application areas of IoT in 5G systems. We, therefore, outline some of the important research directions in 5G IoT.",

      "title": "Machine Learning in IoT Security: Current Solutions and Future Challenges",
      "abstract": "The future Internet of Things (IoT) will have a deep economical, commercial and social impact on our lives. The participating nodes in IoT networks are usually resource-constrained, which makes them luring targets for cyber attacks. In this regard, extensive efforts have been made to address the security and privacy issues in IoT networks primarily through traditional cryptographic approaches. However, the unique characteristics of IoT nodes render the existing solutions insufficient to encompass the entire security spectrum of the IoT networks. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, which are able to provide embedded intelligence in the IoT devices and networks, can be leveraged to cope with different security problems. In this paper, we systematically review the security requirements, attack vectors, and the current security solutions for the IoT networks. We then shed light on the gaps in these security solutions that call for ML and DL approaches. Finally, we discuss in detail the existing ML and DL solutions for addressing different security problems in IoT networks. We also discuss several future research directions for ML- and DL-based IoT security.",

      "title": "Green Resource Allocation Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning in Content-Centric IoT",
      "abstract": "In the era of information, the green services of content-centric IoT are expected to offer users the better satisfaction of Quality of Experience (QoE) than that in a conventional IoT. Nevertheless, the network traffic and new demands from IoT users increase along with the promising of the content-centric computing system. Therefore, the satisfaction of QoE will become the major challenge in the content-centric computing system for IoT users. In this article, to enhance the satisfaction of QoE, we propose QoE models to evaluate the qualities of the IoT concerning both network and users. The value of QoE does not only refer to the network cost, but also the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) of users. Therefore, our models could capture the influence factors from network cost and services for IoT users based on IoT conditions. Specially, we mainly focus on the issues of cache allocation and transmission rate. Under this content-centric IoT, aiming to allocate the cache capacity among content-centric computing nodes and handle the transmission rates under a constrained total network cost and MOS for the whole IoT, we devote our efforts to the following two aspects. First, we formulate the QoE as a green resource allocation problem under the different transmission rate to acquire the best QoE. Then, in the basis of the node centrality, we will propose a suboptimal dynamic approach, which is suitable for IoT with content delivery frequently. Furthermore, we present a green resource allocation algorithm based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to improve accuracy of QoE adaptively. Simulation results reveal that our proposals could achieve high QoE performance for content-centric IoT.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of IoT devices that can be more easily compromised than desktop computers has led to an increase in IoT-based botnet attacks. To mitigate this threat, there is a need for new methods that detect attacks launched from compromised IoT devices and that differentiate between hours- and milliseconds-long IoT-based attacks. In this article, we propose a novel network-based anomaly detection method for the IoT called N-BaIoT that extracts behavior snapshots of the network and uses deep autoencoders to detect anomalous network traffic from compromised IoT devices. To evaluate our method, we infected nine commercial IoT devices in our lab with two widely known IoT-based botnets, Mirai and BASHLITE. The evaluation results demonstrated our proposed methods ability to accurately and instantly detect the attacks as they were being launched from the compromised IoT devices that were part of a botnet.",

Extending the technology to the Internet of things (IoT), we can obtain a verifiable and traceable IoT network. Emerging research in IoT applications exploits blockchain technology to record transaction data, optimize current system performance, or construct next-generation systems, which can provide additional security, automatic transaction management, decentralized platforms, offline-to-online data verification, and so on. In this article, we conduct a systematic survey of the key components of IoT blockchain and examine a number of popular blockchain applications. In particular, we first give an architecture overview of popular IoT-blockchain systems by analyzing their network structures and protocols. Then, we discuss variant consensus protocols for IoT blockchains, and make comparisons among different consensus algorithms. Finally, we analyze the traffic model for P2P and blockchain systems and provide several metrics. We also provide a suitable traffic model for IoT-blockchain systems to illustrate network traffic distribution.",

In IoT, anything can be a portion of it, whether it is unintelligent objects or sensor nodes; thus extremely different kinds of services can be developed. In this regard, data storage, resource management, service creation and discovery, and resource and power management would facilitate advanced mechanism and much better infrastructure. Cloud computing and fog computing play an important role when the quantity of data and information IoT are critical. Thus, it would not be potential for standalone strength forced IoT to handle. Cloud of things is an integration of IoT with cloud computing or fog computing which can aid to realize the objectives of evolving IoT and future Internet. Fog computing is an expansion to the notion of cloud computing to the network brim, making it suitable for IoT and other implementations that need real-time and fundamental interactions. Regardless of many virtually and services unlimited resources presented by cloud-like intelligent building monitoring and others, it yet countenances various difficulties when interfering many smart things in human\u2019s life. Mobility, response time, and location consciousness are the most prominent problems. Fog and mobile edge computing have been established, to get rid of these difficulties of cloud computing. In this article, we suggest a novel framework based on computer propped diagnosis and IoT to detect and observe type-2 diabetes patients. The recommended healthcare system aims to obtain a better accuracy of diagnosis with mysterious data.

      "abstract": "Privacy and security are among the significant challenges of the Internet of Things (IoT). Improper device updates, lack of efficient and robust security protocols, user unawareness, and famous active device monitoring are among the challenges that IoT is facing. In this work, we are exploring the background of IoT systems and security measures, and identifying (a) different security and privacy issues, (b) approaches used to secure the components of IoT-based environments and systems, (c) existing security solutions, and (d) the best privacy models necessary and suitable for different layers of IoT driven applications. In this work, we proposed a new IoT layered model: generic and stretched with the privacy and security components and layers identification. The proposed cloud/edge supported IoT system is implemented and evaluated. The lower layer represented by the IoT nodes generated from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) as Virtual Machines. The middle layer (edge) implemented as a Raspberry Pi 4 hardware kit with support of the Greengrass Edge Environment in AWS. We used the cloud-enabled IoT environment in AWS to implement the top layer (the cloud). The security protocols and critical management sessions were between each of these layers to ensure the privacy of the users\u2019 information. We implemented security certificates to allow data transfer between the layers of the proposed cloud/edge enabled IoT model. Not only is the proposed system model eliminating possible security vulnerabilities, but it also can be used along with the best security techniques to countermeasure the cybersecurity threats facing each one of the layers; cloud, edge, and IoT.",

      "abstract": "Anomaly detection is a problem with applications for a wide variety of domains; it involves the identification of novel or unexpected observations or sequences within the data being captured. The majority of current anomaly detection methods are highly specific to the individual use case, requiring expert knowledge of the method as well as the situation to which it is being applied. The Internet of Things (IoT) as a rapidly expanding field offers many opportunities for this type of data analysis to be implemented, however, due to the nature of the IoT, this may be difficult. This review provides a background on the challenges which may be encountered when applying anomaly detection techniques to IoT data, with examples of applications for the IoT anomaly detection taken from the literature. We discuss a range of approaches that have been developed across a variety of domains, not limited to IoT due to the relative novelty of this application. Finally, we summarize the current challenges being faced in the anomaly detection domain with a view to identifying potential research opportunities for the future.",

      "title": "Towards Workload Balancing in Fog Computing Empowered IoT",
      "abstract": "As latency is the key performance metric for IoT applications, fog nodes co-located with cellular base stations can move the computing resources close to IoT devices. Therefore, data flows of IoT devices can be offloaded to fog nodes in their proximity, instead of the remote cloud, for processing. However, the latency of data flows in IoT devices consist of both the communications latency and computing latency. Owing to the spatial and temporal dynamics of IoT device distributions, some BSs and fog nodes are lightly loaded, while others, which may be overloaded, may incur congestion. Thus, the traffic load allocation among base stations (BSs) and computing load allocation among fog nodes affect the communications latency and computing latency of data flows, respectively. To solve this problem, we propose a workload balancing scheme in a fog network to minimize the latency of data flows in the communications and processing procedures by associating IoT devices to suitable BSs. We further prove the convergence and the optimality of the proposed workload balancing scheme. Through extensive simulations, we have compared the performance of the proposed load balancing scheme with other schemes and verified its advantages for fog networking.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next era of communication. Using the IoT, physical objects can be empowered to create, receive, and exchange data in a seamless manner. Various IoT applications focus on automating different tasks and are trying to empower the inanimate physical objects to act without any human intervention. The existing and upcoming IoT applications are highly promising to increase the level of comfort, efficiency, and automation for the users. To be able to implement such a world in an ever-growing fashion requires high security, privacy, authentication, and recovery from attacks. In this regard, it is imperative to make the required changes in the architecture of the IoT applications for achieving end-to-end secure IoT environments. In this paper, a detailed review of the security-related challenges and sources of threat in the IoT applications is presented. After discussing the security issues, various emerging and existing technologies focused on achieving a high degree of trust in the IoT applications are discussed. Four different technologies, blockchain, fog computing, edge computing, and machine learning, to increase the level of security in IoT are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Medical care has become one of the most indispensable parts of human lives, leading to a dramatic increase in medical big data. To streamline the diagnosis and treatment process, healthcare professionals are now adopting Internet of Things (IoT)-based wearable technology. Recent years have witnessed billions of sensors, devices, and vehicles being connected through the Internet. One such technology\u2014remote patient monitoring\u2014is common nowadays for the treatment and care of patients. However, these technologies also pose grave privacy risks and security concerns about the data transfer and the logging of data transactions. These security and privacy problems of medical data could result from a delay in treatment progress, even endangering the patient\u2019s life. We propose the use of a blockchain to provide secure management and analysis of healthcare big data. However, blockchains are computationally expensive, demand high bandwidth and extra computational power, and are therefore not completely suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices meant for smart cities. In this work, we try to resolve the above-mentioned issues of using blockchain with IoT devices. We propose a novel framework of modified blockchain models suitable for IoT devices that rely on their distributed nature and other additional privacy and security properties of the network. These additional privacy and security properties in our model are based on advanced cryptographic primitives. The solutions given here make IoT application data and transactions more secure and anonymous over a blockchain-based network.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) and its applications are the most popular research areas at present. The characteristics of IoT on one side make it easily applicable to real-life applications, whereas on the other side expose it to cyber threats. Denial of Service (DoS) is one of the most catastrophic attacks against IoT. In this paper, we investigate the prospects of using machine learning classification algorithms for securing IoT against DoS attacks. A comprehensive study is carried on the classifiers which can advance the development of anomaly-based intrusion detection systems (IDSs). Performance assessment of classifiers is done in terms of prominent metrics and validation methods. Popular datasets CIDDS-001, UNSW-NB15, and NSL-KDD are used for benchmarking classifiers. Friedman and Nemenyi tests are employed to analyze the significant differences among classifiers statistically. In addition, Raspberry Pi is used to evaluate the response time of classifiers on IoT specific hardware. We also discuss a methodology for selecting the best classifier as per application requirements. The main goals of this study are to motivate IoT security researchers for developing IDSs using ensemble learning, and suggesting appropriate methods for statistical assessment of classifier\u2019s performance.",

      "abstract": "Currently, edge computing (EC), emerging as a burgeoning paradigm, is powerful in handling real-time resource provision for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, due to the spatial distribution of geographically sparse IoT devices and the resource limitations of EC units (ECUs), the resource utilization of corresponding edge servers is relatively insufficient and the execution performance is ineffective to some extent. A privacy leakage, including personal information, location, media data, etc., during the transmission process from IoT devices to edge servers severely restricts the application of ECUs in IoT. To address these challenges, a two-phase offloading optimization strategy is put forward for joint optimization of offloading utility and privacy in EC enabled IoT. Technically, a utility-aware task offloading method, named UTO, is devised first to obtain the goal of maximizing the resource utilization of ECUs and minimizing the implementation time cost. Then a joint optimization method, named JOM, for utility and privacy tradeoffs is designed to balance the privacy preservation and execution performance. Eventually, the experimental evaluations are designed to illustrate the efficiency and reliability of UTO and JOM.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) have widely penetrated in different aspects of modern life and many intelligent IoT services and applications are emerging. Recently, federated learning is proposed to train a globally shared model by exploiting a massive amount of user-generated data samples on IoT devices while preventing data leakage. However, the device, statistical and model heterogeneities inherent in the complex IoT environments pose great challenges to traditional federated learning, making it unsuitable to be directly deployed. In this paper, we advocate a personalized federated learning framework in a cloud-edge architecture for intelligent IoT applications. To cope with the heterogeneity issues in IoT environments, we investigate emerging personalized federated learning methods which are able to mitigate the negative effects caused by heterogeneities in different aspects. With the power of edge computing, the requirements for fast-processing capacity and low latency in intelligent IoT applications can also be achieved. We finally provide a case study of IoT based human activity recognition to demonstrate the effectiveness of personalized federated learning for intelligent IoT applications.",

      "abstract": "The security issue impacting the Internet-of-Things (IoT) paradigm has recently attracted significant attention from the research community. To this end, several surveys were put forward addressing various IoT-centric topics, including intrusion detection systems, threat modeling, and emerging technologies. In contrast, in this paper, we exclusively focus on the ever-evolving IoT vulnerabilities. In this context, we initially provide a comprehensive classification of state-of-the-art surveys, which address various dimensions of the IoT paradigm. This aims at facilitating IoT research endeavors by amalgamating, comparing, and contrasting dispersed research contributions. Subsequently, we provide a unique taxonomy, which sheds the light on IoT vulnerabilities, their attack vectors, impacts on numerous security objectives, attacks which exploit such vulnerabilities, corresponding remediation methodologies and currently offered operational cyber security capabilities to infer and monitor such weaknesses. This aims at providing the reader with a multidimensional research perspective related to IoT vulnerabilities, including their technical details and consequences, which is postulated to be leveraged for remediation objectives. Additionally, motivated by the lack of empirical (and malicious) data related to the IoT paradigm, this paper also presents a first look on Internet-scale IoT exploitations by drawing upon more than 1.2 GB of macroscopic, passive measurements\u2019 data. This aims at practically highlighting the severity of the IoT problem, while providing operational situational awareness capabilities, which undoubtedly would aid in the mitigation task, at large. Insightful findings, inferences and outcomes in addition to open challenges and research problems are also disclosed in this paper, which we hope would pave the way for future research endeavors addressing theoretical and empirical aspects related to the imperative topic of IoT security.",

      "abstract": "Pervasive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) is visible across the globe. The 2016 Dyn cyberattack exposed the critical fault-lines among smart networks. Security of IoT has become a critical concern. The danger exposed by infested Internet-connected Things not only affects the security of IoT but also threatens the complete Internet eco-system which can possibly exploit the vulnerable Things (smart devices) deployed as botnets. Mirai malware compromised the video surveillance devices and paralyzed Internet via distributed denial of service attacks. In the recent past, security attack vectors have evolved bothways, in terms of complexity and diversity. Hence, to identify and prevent or detect novel attacks, it is important to analyze techniques in IoT context. This survey classifies the IoT security threats and challenges for IoT networks by evaluating existing defense techniques. Our main focus is on network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs); hence, this paper reviews existing NIDS implementation tools and datasets as well as free and open-source network sniffing software. Then, it surveys, analyzes, and compares state-of-the-art NIDS proposals in the IoT context in terms of architecture, detection methodologies, validation strategies, treated threats, and algorithm deployments. The review deals with both traditional and machine learning (ML) NIDS techniques and discusses future directions. In this survey, our focus is on IoT NIDS deployed via ML since learning algorithms have a good success rate in security and privacy. The survey provides a comprehensive review of NIDSs deploying different aspects of learning techniques for IoT, unlike other top surveys targeting the traditional systems. We believe that, this paper will be useful for academia and industry research, first, to identify IoT threats and challenges, second, to implement their own NIDS and finally to propose new smart techniques in IoT context considering IoT limitations. Moreover, the survey will enable security individuals differentiate IoT NIDS from traditional ones.",

      "title": "Complementing IoT Services Through Software Defined Networking and Edge Computing: A Comprehensive Survey",
      "abstract": "Millions of sensors continuously produce and transmit data to control real-world infrastructures using complex networks in the Internet of Things (IoT). However, IoT devices are limited in computational power, including storage, processing, and communication resources, to effectively perform compute-intensive tasks locally. Edge computing resolves the resource limitation problems by bringing computation closer to the edge of IoT devices. Providing distributed edge nodes across the network reduces the stress of centralized computation and overcomes latency challenges in the IoT. Therefore, edge computing presents low-cost solutions for compute-intensive tasks. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) enables effective network management by presenting a global perspective of the network. While SDN was not explicitly developed for IoT challenges, it can, however, provide impetus to solve the complexity issues and help in efficient IoT service orchestration. The current IoT paradigm of massive data generation, complex infrastructures, security vulnerabilities, and requirements from the newly developed technologies make IoT realization a challenging issue. In this research, we provide an extensive survey on SDN and the edge computing ecosystem to solve the challenge of complex IoT management. We present the latest research on Software-Defined Internet of Things orchestration using Edge (SDIoT-Edge) and highlight key requirements and standardization efforts in integrating these diverse architectures. An extensive discussion on different case studies using SDIoT-Edge computing is presented to envision the underlying concept. Furthermore, we classify state-of-the-art research in the SDIoT-Edge ecosystem based on multiple performance parameters. We comprehensively present security and privacy vulnerabilities in the SDIoT-Edge computing and provide detailed taxonomies of multiple attack possibilities in this paradigm. We highlight the lessons learned based on our findings at the end of each section. Finally, we discuss critical insights toward current research issues, challenges, and further research directions to efficiently provide IoT services in the SDIoT-Edge paradigm.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is stepping out of its infancy into full maturity and establishing itself as a part of the future Internet. One of the technical challenges of having billions of devices deployed worldwide is the ability to manage them. Although access management technologies exist in IoT, they are based on centralized models which introduce a new variety of technical limitations to manage them globally. In this paper, we propose a new architecture for arbitrating roles and permissions in IoT. The new architecture is a fully distributed access control system for IoT based on blockchain technology. The architecture is backed by a proof of concept implementation and evaluated in realistic IoT scenarios. The results show that the blockchain technology could be used as access management technology in specific scalable IoT scenarios.",

      "abstract": "In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), an enormous amount of sensing devices collect and/or generate various sensory data over time for a wide range of fields and applications. Based on the nature of the application, these devices will result in big or fast/real-time data streams. Applying analytics over such data streams to discover new information, predict future insights, and make control decisions is a crucial process that makes IoT a worthy paradigm for businesses and a quality-of-life improving technology. In this paper, we provide a thorough overview on using a class of advanced machine learning techniques, namely deep learning (DL), to facilitate the analytics and learning in the IoT domain. We start by articulating IoT data characteristics and identifying two major treatments for IoT data from a machine learning perspective, namely IoT big data analytics and IoT streaming data analytics. We also discuss why DL is a promising approach to achieve the desired analytics in these types of data and applications. The potential of using emerging DL techniques for IoT data analytics are then discussed, and its promises and challenges are introduced. We present a comprehensive background on different DL architectures and algorithms. We also analyze and summarize major reported research attempts that leveraged DL in the IoT domain. The smart IoT devices that have incorporated DL in their intelligence background are also discussed. DL implementation approaches on the fog and cloud centers in support of IoT applications are also surveyed. Finally, we shed light on some challenges and potential directions for future research. At the end of each section, we highlight the lessons learned based on our experiments and review of the recent literature.",

      "title": "Unsupervised intelligent system based on one class support vector machine and Grey Wolf optimization for IoT botnet detection",
      "abstract": "Recently, the number of Internet of Things (IoT) botnet attacks has increased tremendously due to the expansion of online IoT devices which can be easily compromised. Botnets are a common threat that takes advantage of the lack of basic security tools in IoT devices and can perform a series of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Developing new methods to detect compromised IoT devices is urgent in order to mitigate the negative consequences of these IoT botnets since the existing IoT botnet detection methods still present some issues, such as, relying on labelled data, not being validated with newer botnets, and using very complex machine learning algorithms. Anomaly detection methods are promising for detecting IoT botnet attacks since the amount of available normal data is very large. One of the powerful algorithms that can be used for anomaly detection is One Class Support vector machine (OCSVM). The efficiency of the OCSVM algorithm depends on several factors that greatly affect the classification results such as the subset of features that are used for training OCSVM model, the kernel type, and its hyperparameters. In this paper, a new unsupervised evolutionary IoT botnet detection method is proposed. The main contribution of the proposed method is to detect IoT botnet attacks launched form compromised IoT devices by exploiting the efficiency of a recent swarm intelligence algorithm called Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm (GWO) to optimize the hyperparameters of the OCSVM and at the same time to find the features that best describe the IoT botnet problem. To prove the efficiency of the proposed method, its performance is evaluated using typical anomaly detection evaluation measures over a new version of a real benchmark dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms all other algorithms in terms of true positive rate, false positive rate, and G-mean for all IoT device types. Also, it achieves the lowest detection time, while significantly reducing the number of selected features.",

Because of its multilayer structure, deep learning is also appropriate for the edge computing environment. Therefore, in this article, we first introduce deep learning for IoTs into the edge computing environment. Since existing edge nodes have limited processing capability, we also design a novel offloading strategy to optimize the performance of IoT deep learning applications with edge computing. In the performance evaluation, we test the performance of executing multiple deep learning tasks in an edge computing environment with our strategy.

      "abstract": "Smart city is gradually forming a large scope of Internet of Things (IoT) networks with diffusely deployed IoT devices that produce quantities of services. Considering the large-scale and widely distributed features of IoT networks, edge computing is emerged as a powerful and suitable paradigm to provide computing abilities for the IoT devices at the edge of the networks. In edge computing, the IoT services could be placed on the edge computing units (ECUs) for execution, which provides low latency and eases the burden of bandwidth. However, it is still challenging to improve the overall ECU execution performance (i.e., the resource usage, the load balance levels, and the power consumption of ECUs) and meanwhile prevent privacy leakage of the IoT devices for service placement. To tackle this challenge, a trust-oriented IoT service placement method, abbreviated as TSP, is proposed for smart cities in edge computing. Technically, improving the strength Pareto evolutionary algorithm (SPEA2) is leveraged to acquire the balanced placement strategies for the tradeoffs among the execution performance metrics with privacy preservation. Additionally, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques are employed to identify the optimal placement strategy among the obtained service placement strategies. Eventually, systematic experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency and reliability of TSP.",

In this survey, we provide a broad view of the existing wireless IoT connectivity technologies and discuss several new emerging technologies and solutions that can be effectively used to enable massive connectivity for IoT. In particular, we categorize the existing wireless IoT connectivity technologies based on coverage range and review diverse types of connectivity technologies with different specifications. We also point out key technical challenges of the existing connectivity technologies for enabling massive IoT connectivity. To address the challenges, we further review and discuss some examples of promising technologies such as compressive sensing (CS) random access, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and massive multiple input multiple output (mMIMO) based random access that could be employed in future standards for supporting IoT connectivity. Finally, a classification of IoT applications is considered in terms of various service requirements. For each group of classified applications, we outline its suitable IoT connectivity options.",

      "abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) is a promising solution to connect and access every device through internet. Every day the device count increases with large diversity in shape, size, usage and complexity. Since IoT drive the world and changes people lives with its wide range of services and applications. However, IoT provides numerous services through applications, it faces severe security issues and vulnerable to attacks such as sinkhole attack, eaves dropping, denial of service attacks, etc., Intrusion detection system is used to detect such attacks when the network security is breached. This research work proposed an intrusion detection system for IoT network and detect different types of attacks based on hybrid convolutional neural network model. Proposed model is suitable for wide range of IoT applications. Proposed research work is validated and compared with conventional machine learning and deep learning model. Experimental result demonstrate that proposed hybrid model is more sensitive to attacks in the IoT network.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) devices can apply mobile edge computing (MEC) and energy harvesting (EH) to provide high-level experiences for computational intensive applications and concurrently to prolong the lifetime of the battery. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based offloading scheme for an IoT device with EH to select the edge device and the offloading rate according to the current battery level, the previous radio transmission rate to each edge device, and the predicted amount of the harvested energy. This scheme enables the IoT device to optimize the offloading policy without knowledge of the MEC model, the energy consumption model, and the computation latency model. Further, we present a deep RL-based offloading scheme to further accelerate the learning speed. Their performance bounds in terms of the energy consumption, computation latency, and utility are provided for three typical offloading scenarios and verified via simulations for an IoT device that uses wireless power transfer for energy harvesting. Simulation results show that the proposed RL-based offloading scheme reduces the energy consumption, computation latency, and task drop rate, and thus increases the utility of the IoT device in the dynamic MEC in comparison with the benchmark offloading schemes.",

      "abstract": "Despite the perception people may have regarding the agricultural process, the reality is that today\u2019s agriculture industry is data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost every industry including \u201csmart agriculture\u201d which moved the industry from statistical to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary changes are shaking the existing agriculture methods and creating new opportunities along a range of challenges. This article highlights the potential of wireless sensors and IoT in agriculture, as well as the challenges expected to be faced when integrating this technology with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices and communication techniques associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture applications are analyzed in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture application, like soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection are listed. How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages, from sowing until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable applications such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) security and privacy remain a major challenge, mainly due to the massive scale and distributed nature of IoT networks. Blockchain-based approaches provide decentralized security and privacy, yet they involve significant energy, delay, and computational overhead that is not suitable for most resource-constrained IoT devices. In our previous work, we presented a lightweight instantiation of a BC particularly geared for use in IoT by eliminating the Proof of Work (POW) and the concept of coins. Our approach was exemplified in a smart home setting and consists of three main tiers namely: cloud storage, overlay, and smart home. In this paper we delve deeper and outline the various core components and functions of the smart home tier. Each smart home is equipped with an always online, high resource device, known as \u201cminer\u201d that is responsible for handling all communication within and external to the home. The miner also preserves a private and secure BC, used for controlling and auditing communications. We show that our proposed BC-based smart home framework is secure by thoroughly analysing its security with respect to the fundamental security goals of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Finally, we present simulation results to highlight that the overheads (in terms of traffic, processing time and energy consumption) introduced by our approach are insignificant relative to its security and privacy gains.",

      "abstract": "The surge in global population is compelling a shift toward smart agriculture practices. This coupled with the diminishing natural resources, limited availability of arable land, increase in unpredictable weather conditions makes food security a major concern for most countries. As a result, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) and data analytics (DA) are employed to enhance the operational efficiency and productivity in the agriculture sector. There is a paradigm shift from use of wireless sensor network (WSN) as a major driver of smart agriculture to the use of IoT and DA. The IoT integrates several existing technologies, such as WSN, radio frequency identification, cloud computing, middleware systems, and end-user applications. In this paper, several benefits and challenges of IoT have been identified. We present the IoT ecosystem and how the combination of IoT and DA is enabling smart agriculture. Furthermore, we provide future trends and opportunities which are categorized into technological innovations, application scenarios, business, and marketability.",

      "title": "A Software Defined Fog Node Based Distributed Blockchain Cloud Architecture for IoT",
      "abstract": "The recent expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the consequent explosion in the volume of data produced by smart devices have led to the outsourcing of data to designated data centers. However, to manage these huge data stores, centralized data centers, such as cloud storage cannot afford auspicious way. There are many challenges that must be addressed in the traditional network architecture due to the rapid growth in the diversity and number of devices connected to the internet, which is not designed to provide high availability, real-time data delivery, scalability, security, resilience, and low latency. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel blockchain-based distributed cloud architecture with a software defined networking (SDN) enable controller fog nodes at the edge of the network to meet the required design principles. The proposed model is a distributed cloud architecture based on blockchain technology, which provides low-cost, secure, and on-demand access to the most competitive computing infrastructures in an IoT network. By creating a distributed cloud infrastructure, the proposed model enables cost-effective high-performance computing. Furthermore, to bring computing resources to the edge of the IoT network and allow low latency access to large amounts of data in a secure manner, we provide a secure distributed fog node architecture that uses SDN and blockchain techniques. Fog nodes are distributed fog computing entities that allow the deployment of fog services, and are formed by multiple computing resources at the edge of the IoT network. We evaluated the performance of our proposed architecture and compared it with the existing models using various performance measures. The results of our evaluation show that performance is improved by reducing the induced delay, reducing the response time, increasing throughput, and the ability to detect real-time attacks in the IoT network with low performance overheads.",

However, security and privacy issues are a great challenge for IoT but they are also enabling factors to create a \u201ctrust ecosystem.\u201d In fact, the intrinsic vulnerabilities of IoT devices, with limited resources and heterogeneous technologies, together with the lack of specifically designed IoT standards, represent a fertile ground for the expansion of specific cyber threats. In this paper, we try to bring order on the IoT security panorama providing a taxonomic analysis from the perspective of the three main key layers of the IoT system model: 1) perception; 2) transportation; and 3) application levels. As a result of the analysis, we will highlight the most critical issues with the aim of guiding future research directions.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the interconnection of smart devices to collect data and make intelligent decisions. However, a lack of intrinsic security measures makes IoT vulnerable to privacy and security threats. With its \u201csecurity by design,\u201d Blockchain (BC) can help in addressing major security requirements in IoT. BC capabilities like immutability, transparency, auditability, data encryption and operational resilience can help solve most architectural shortcomings of IoT. This article presents a comprehensive survey on BC and IoT integration. The objective of this paper is to analyze the current research trends on the usage of BC-related approaches and technologies in an IoT context. This paper presents the following novelties, with respect to related work: (i) it covers different application domains, organizing the available literature according to this categorization, (ii) it introduces two usage patterns, i.e., device manipulation and data management (open marketplace solution), and (iii) it reports on the development level of some of the presented solutions. We also analyze the main challenges faced by the research community in the smooth integration of BC and IoT, and point out the main open issues and future research directions. Last but not least, we also present a survey about novel uses of BC in the machine economy.",

      "title": "IoT SENTINEL: Automated Device-Type Identification for Security Enforcement in IoT",
      "abstract": "With the rapid growth of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), concerns about the security of IoT devices have become prominent. Several vendors are producing IP-connected devices for home and small office networks that often suffer from flawed security designs and implementations. They also tend to lack mechanisms for firmware updates or patches that can help eliminate security vulnerabilities. Securing networks where the presence of such vulnerable devices is given, requires a brownfield approach: applying necessary protection measures within the network so that potentially vulnerable devices can coexist without endangering the security of other devices in the same network. In this paper, we present IoT Sentinel, a system capable of automatically identifying the types of devices being connected to an IoT network and enabling enforcement of rules for constraining the communications of vulnerable devices so as to minimize damage resulting from their compromise. We show that IoT Sentinel is effective in identifying device types and has minimal performance overhead.",

However, the varying IoT infrastructures (i.e., cloud, edge, fog) and the limitations of the IoT application layer protocols in transmitting/receiving messages become the barriers in creating intelligent IoT applications. These barriers prevent current intelligent IoT applications to adaptively learn from other IoT applications. In this paper, we critically review how IoT-generated data are processed for machine learning analysis and highlight the current challenges in furthering intelligent solutions in the IoT environment. Furthermore, we propose a framework to enable IoT applications to adaptively learn from other IoT applications and present a case study in how the framework can be applied to the real studies in the literature. Finally, we discuss the key factors that have an impact on future intelligent applications for the IoT.",

      "abstract": "Connectivity is probably the most basic building block of the IoT paradigm. Up to now, the two main approaches to provide data access to things have been based on either multihop mesh networks using short-range communication technologies in the unlicensed spectrum, or long-range legacy cellular technologies, mainly 2G/GSM/GPRS, operating in the corresponding licensed frequency bands. Recently, these reference models have been challenged by a new type of wireless connectivity, characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed sub-gigahertz frequency bands, used to realize access networks with star topology referred to as low-power WANs (LPWANs). In this article, we introduce this new approach to provide connectivity in the IoT scenario, discussing its advantages over the established paradigms in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and architectural design, particularly for typical smart city applications.",

Accounting for the features and constraints of IoT devices, traditional security countermeasures can be inefficient in dynamic IoT environments. In this vein, the advantages introduced by software defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) have the potential to reshape the landscape of cybersecurity for IoT systems. To this aim, we provide a comprehensive analysis of security features introduced by NFV and SDN, describing the manifold strategies able to monitor, protect, and react to IoT security threats. We also present lessons learned in the adoption of SDN/NFV-based protection approaches in IoT environments, comparing them with conventional security countermeasures. Finally, we deeply discuss the open challenges related to emerging SDN- and NFV-based security mechanisms, aiming to provide promising directives to conduct future research in this fervent area.",

      "title": "Towards an Optimized BlockChain for IoT",
      "abstract": "There has been increasing interest in adopting BlockChain (BC), that underpins the crypto-currency Bitcoin, in Internet of Things (IoT) for security and privacy. However, BCs are computationally expensive and involve high bandwidth overhead and delays, which are not suitable for most IoT devices. This paper proposes a lightweight BC-based architecture for IoT that virtually eliminates the overheads of classic BC, while maintaining most of its security and privacy benefits. IoT devices benefit from a private immutable ledger, that acts similar to BC but is managed centrally, to optimize energy consumption. High resource devices create an overlay network to implement a publicly accessible distributed BC that ensures end-to-end security and privacy. The proposed architecture uses distributed trust to reduce the block validation processing time. We explore our approach in a smart home setting as a representative case study for broader IoT applications. Qualitative evaluation of the architecture under common threat models highlights its effectiveness in providing security and privacy for IoT applications. Simulations demonstrate that our method decreases packet and processing overhead significantly compared to the BC implementation used in Bitcoin.",

      "title": "Managing IoT devices using blockchain platform",
      "abstract": "Since the start of Bitcoin in 2008[1], blockchain technology emerged as the next revolutionary technology. Though blockchain started off as a core technology of Bitcoin, its use cases are expanding to many other areas including finances, Internet of Things (IoT), security and such[2]. Currently, many private and public sectors are diving into the technology[3]. Aside from that, as software and hardware improve, we would see the beginning of IoT. And those IoT devices need to communicate and synchronize with each other. But in situations where more than thousands or tens of thousands of IoT devices connected, we expect that using current model of server-client may have some limitations and issues while in synchronization. So, we propose using blockchain to build IoT system. Using blockchain, we can control and configure IoT devices. We manage keys using RSA public key cryptosystems where public keys are stored in Ethereum and private keys are saved on individual devices. Specifically, we choose Ethereum as our blockchain platform because using its smart contract, we can write our own Turing-complete code to run on top of Ethereum. Thus, we can easily manage configuration of IoT devices and build key management system. Even though we can simply use account as a key management system, which most of blockchain platform supports, we decide to use Ethereum because we can manage the system in a more fine-grained way. For the proof of a concept, we use a few IoT devices instead of a full system of IoT system, which consists of thousands of IoT devices. But in our later study, we would like to build a fully scaled IoT system using blockchain.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is an increasingly popular technology that enables physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, etc., to communicate and even inter operate with one another. It has been widely used in industrial production and social applications including smart home, healthcare, and industrial automation. While bringing unprecedented convenience, accessibility, and efficiency, IoT has caused acute security and privacy threats in recent years. There are increasing research works to ease these threats, but many problems remain open. To better understand the essential reasons of new IoT threats and the challenges in current research, this survey first proposes the concept of \u201cIoT features.\u201d Then, we discuss the security and privacy effects of eight IoT features including the threats they cause, existing solutions to threats and research challenges yet to be solved. To help researchers follow the up-to-date works in this field, this paper finally illustrates the developing trend of IoT security research and reveals how IoT features affect existing security research by investigating most existing research works related to IoT security from 2013 to 2017.",

      "abstract": "Voluminous amounts of data have been produced, since the past decade as the miniaturization of Internet of things (IoT) devices increases. However, such data are not useful without analytic power. Numerous big data, IoT, and analytics solutions have enabled people to obtain valuable insight into large data generated by IoT devices. However, these solutions are still in their infancy, and the domain lacks a comprehensive survey. This paper investigates the state-of-the-art research efforts directed toward big IoT data analytics. The relationship between big data analytics and IoT is explained. Moreover, this paper adds value by proposing a new architecture for big IoT data analytics. Furthermore, big IoT data analytic types, methods, and technologies for big data mining are discussed. Numerous notable use cases are also presented. Several opportunities brought by data analytics in IoT paradigm are then discussed. Finally, open research challenges, such as privacy, big data mining, visualization, and integration, are presented as future research directions.",

      "abstract": "Home-based IoT devices have a bleak reputation regarding their security practices. On the surface, the insecurities of IoT devices seem to be caused by integration problems that may be addressed by simple measures, but this work finds that to be a naive assumption. The truth is, IoT deployments, at their core, utilize traditional compute systems, such as embedded, mobile, and network. These components have many unexplored challenges such as the effect of over-privileged mobile applications on embedded devices. Our work proposes a methodology that researchers and practitioners could employ to analyze security properties for home-based IoT devices. We systematize the literature for home-based IoT using this methodology in order to understand attack techniques, mitigations, and stakeholders. Further, we evaluate \\numDevices devices to augment the systematized literature in order to identify neglected research areas. To make this analysis transparent and easier to adapt by the community, we provide a public portal to share our evaluation data and invite the community to contribute their independent findings.",

The realization of IoT systems will enable seamless integration of the cyber world with our physical world and will fundamentally change and empower human interaction with the world. A key technology in the realization of IoT systems is middleware, which is usually described as a software system designed to be the intermediary between IoT devices and applications. In this paper, we first motivate the need for an IoT middleware via an IoT application designed for real-time prediction of blood alcohol content using smartwatch sensor data. This is then followed by a survey on the capabilities of the existing IoT middleware. We further conduct a thorough analysis of the challenges and the enabling technologies in developing an IoT middleware that embraces the heterogeneity of IoT devices and also supports the essential ingredients of composition, adaptability, and security aspects of an IoT system.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, green energy management systems (smart grid, smart buildings, and so on) have received huge research and industrial attention with the explosive development of smart cities. By introducing Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart cities are able to achieve exquisite energy management by ubiquitous monitoring and reliable communications. However, long-term energy efficiency has become an important issue when using an IoT-based network structure. In this article, we focus on designing an IoT-based energy management system based on edge computing infrastructure with deep reinforcement learning. First, an overview of IoT-based energy management in smart cities is described. Then the framework and software model of an IoT-based system with edge computing are proposed. After that, we present an efficient energy scheduling scheme with deep reinforcement learning for the proposed framework. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly spreading, reaching a multitude of different domains, including personal health care, environmental monitoring, home automation, smart mobility, and Industry 4.0. As a consequence, more and more IoT devices are being deployed in a variety of public and private environments, progressively becoming common objects of everyday life. It is hence apparent that, in such a scenario, cybersecurity becomes critical to avoid threats like leakage of sensible information, denial of service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized network access, and so on. Unfortunately, many low-end IoT commercial products do not usually support strong security mechanisms, and can hence be target of\u2014or even means for\u2014a number of security attacks. The aim of this article is to provide a broad overview of the security risks in the IoT sector and to discuss some possible counteractions. To this end, after a general introduction to security in the IoT domain, we discuss the specific security mechanisms adopted by the most popular IoT communication protocols. Then, we report and analyze some of the attacks against real IoT devices reported in the literature, in order to point out the current security weaknesses of commercial IoT solutions and remark the importance of considering security as an integral part in the design of IoT systems. We conclude this article with a reasoned comparison of the considered IoT technologies with respect to a set of qualifying security attributes, namely integrity, anonymity, confidentiality, privacy, access control, authentication, authorization, resilience, self organization.",

      "abstract": "IoT devices are increasingly deployed in daily life. Many of these devices are, however, vulnerable due to insecure design, implementation, and configuration. As a result, many networks already have vulnerable IoT devices that are easy to compromise. This has led to a new category of malware specifically targeting IoT devices. However, existing intrusion detection techniques are not effective in detecting compromised IoT devices given the massive scale of the problem in terms of the number of different types of devices and manufacturers involved. In this paper, we present D\u00cfoT, an autonomous self-learning distributed system for detecting compromised IoT devices. D\u00cfoT builds effectively on device-type-specific communication profiles without human intervention nor labeled data that are subsequently used to detect anomalous deviations in devices' communication behavior, potentially caused by malicious adversaries. D\u00cfoT utilizes a federated learning approach for aggregating behavior profiles efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a federated learning approach to anomaly-detection-based intrusion detection. Consequently, D\u00cfoT can cope with emerging new and unknown attacks. We systematically and extensively evaluated more than 30 off-the-shelf IoT devices over a long term and show that D\u00cfoT is highly effective (95.6% detection rate) and fast (257 ms) at detecting devices compromised by, for instance, the infamous Mirai malware. D\u00cfoT reported no false alarms when evaluated in a real-world smart home deployment setting.",

      "abstract": "Low-power wide area networks (LPWANs) constitute a type of networks which is used to connect things to the Internet from a wide variety of sectors. These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation, etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard. We also discuss the research challenges and perspectives.",

      "title": "Privacy-Preserving Support Vector Machine Training Over Blockchain-Based Encrypted IoT Data in Smart Cities",
      "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely used in many smart city sectors, where a huge amount of data is gathered from various (IoT) devices. As a typical ML model, support vector machine (SVM) enables efficient data classification and thereby finds its applications in real-world scenarios, such as disease diagnosis and anomaly detection. Training an SVM classifier usually requires a collection of labeled IoT data from multiple entities, raising great concerns about data privacy. Most of the existing solutions rely on an implicit assumption that the training data can be reliably collected from multiple data providers, which is often not the case in reality. To bridge the gap between ideal assumptions and realistic constraints, in this paper, we propose secureSVM, which is a privacy-preserving SVM training scheme over blockchain-based encrypted IoT data. We utilize the blockchain techniques to build a secure and reliable data sharing platform among multiple data providers, where IoT data is encrypted and then recorded on a distributed ledger. We design secure building blocks, such as secure polynomial multiplication and secure comparison, by employing a homomorphic cryptosystem, Paillier, and construct a secure SVM training algorithm, which requires only two interactions in a single iteration, with no need for a trusted third-party. Rigorous security analysis prove that the proposed scheme ensures the confidentiality of the sensitive data for each data provider as well as the SVM model parameters for data analysts. Extensive experiments demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is entering the daily operation of many industries; applications include but are not limited to smart cities, smart grids, smart homes, physical security, e-health, asset management, and logistics. For example, the concept of smart cities is emerging in multiple continents, where enhanced street lighting controls, infrastructure monitoring, public safety and surveillance, physical security, gunshot detection, meter reading, and transportation analysis and optimization systems are being deployed on a city-wide scale. A related and cost-effective user-level IoT application is the support of IoT-enabled smart buildings. Commercial space has substantial requirements in terms of comfort, usability, security, and energy management. IoT-based systems can support these requirements in an organic manner. In particular, power over Ethernet, as part of an IoT-based solution, offers disruptive opportunities in revolutionizing the in-building connectivity of a large swath of devices. However, a number of deployment-limiting issues currently impact the scope of IoT utilization, including lack of comprehensive end-to-end standards, fragmented cybersecurity solutions, and a relative dearth of fully-developed vertical applications. This paper reviews some of the technical opportunities offered and the technical challenges faced by the IoT in the smart building arena.",

      "abstract": "Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) plays an indispensable role for Industry 4.0, where people are committed to implement a general, scalable, and secure IIoT system to be adopted across various industries. However, existing IIoT systems are vulnerable to single point of failure and malicious attacks, which cannot provide stable services. Due to the resilience and security promise of blockchain, the idea of combining blockchain and Internet of Things (IoT) gains considerable interest. However, blockchains are power-intensive and low-throughput, which are not suitable for power-constrained IoT devices. To tackle these challenges, we present a blockchain system with credit-based consensus mechanism for IIoT. We propose a credit-based proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism for IoT devices, which can guarantee system security and transaction efficiency simultaneously. In order to protect sensitive data confidentiality, we design a data authority management method to regulate the access to sensor data. In addition, our system is built based on directed acyclic graph -structured blockchains, which is more efficient than the Satoshi-style blockchain in performance. We implement the system on Raspberry Pi, and conduct a case study for the smart factory. Extensive evaluation and analysis results demonstrate that credit-based PoW mechanism and data access control are secure and efficient in IIoT.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles are gaining a lot of popularity among an ever growing community of amateurs as well as service providers. Emerging technologies, such as LTE 4G/5G networks and mobile edge computing, will widen the use case scenarios of UAVs. In this article, we discuss the potential of UAVs, equipped with IoT devices, in delivering IoT services from great heights. A high-level view of a UAV-based integrative IoT platform for the delivery of IoT services from large height, along with the overall system orchestrator, is presented in this article. As an envisioned use case of the platform, the article demonstrates how UAVs can be used for crowd surveillance based on face recognition. To evaluate the use case, we study the offloading of video data processing to a MEC node compared to the local processing of video data onboard UAVs. For this, we developed a testbed consisting of a local processing node and one MEC node. To perform face recognition, the Local Binary Pattern Histogram method from the Open Source Computer Vision is used. The obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the MEC-based offloading approach in saving the scarce energy of UAVs, reducing the processing time of recognition, and promptly detecting suspicious persons.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is the ability to provide everyday devices with a way of identification and another way for communication with each other. The spectrum of IoT application domains is very large including smart homes, smart cities, wearables, e-health, etc. Consequently, tens and even hundreds of billions of devices will be connected. Such devices will have smart capabilities to collect, analyze and even make decisions without any human interaction. Security is a supreme requirement in such circumstances, and in particular authentication is of high interest given the damage that could happen from a malicious unauthenticated device in an IoT system. This paper gives a near complete and up-to-date view of the IoT authentication field. It provides a summary of a large range of authentication protocols proposed in the literature. Using a multi-criteria classification previously introduced in our work, it compares and evaluates the proposed authentication protocols, showing their strengths and weaknesses, which constitutes a fundamental first step for researchers and developers addressing this domain.",

      "title": "Deep Cognitive Perspective: Resource Allocation for NOMA-Based Heterogeneous IoT With Imperfect SIC",
      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted significant attentions in the fifth generation mobile networks and the smart cities. However, considering the large numbers of connectivity demands, it is vital to improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of the IoT with an affordable power consumption. To improve the SE, the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technology is newly proposed through accommodating multiple users in the same spectrums. As a result, in this paper, an energy efficient resource allocation (RA) problem is introduced for the NOMA-based heterogeneous IoT. At first, we assume the successive interference cancelation (SIC) is imperfect for practical implementations. Then, based on the analyzing method for cognitive radio networks, we present a stepwise RA scheme for the mobile users and the IoT users with the mutual interference management. Third, we propose a deep recurrent neural network-based algorithm to solve the problem optimally and rapidly. Moreover, a priorities and rate demands-based user scheduling method is supplemented, to coordinate the access of the heterogeneous users with the limited radio resource. At last, the simulation results verify that the deep learning-based scheme is able to provide optimal RA results for the NOMA heterogeneous IoT with fast convergence and low computational complexity. Compared with the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiple access system, the NOMA system with imperfect SIC yields better performance on the SE and the scale of connectivity, at the cost of high power consumption and low energy efficiency.",

Moreover, as repeated/similar service requirements become greater in number, the efficiency of IoT-Cloud services is seriously affected. In this paper, a novel architecture that integrates a trust evaluation mechanism and service template with a balance dynamics based on cloud and edge computing is proposed to overcome these problems. In this architecture, the edge network and the edge platform are designed in such a way as to reduce resource consumption and ensure the extensibility of trust evaluation mechanism, respectively. To improve the efficiency of IoT-Cloud services, the service parameter template is established in the cloud and the service parsing template is established in the edge platform. Moreover, the edge network can assist the edge platform in establishing service parsing templates based on the trust evaluation mechanism and meet special service requirements. The experimental results illustrate that this edge-based architecture can improve both the security and efficiency of IoT-Cloud systems.",

      "abstract": "The smart management of freshwater for precision irrigation in agriculture is essential for increasing crop yield and decreasing costs, while contributing to environmental sustainability. The intense use of technologies offers a means for providing the exact amount of water needed by plants. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the natural choice for smart water management applications, even though the integration of different technologies required for making it work seamlessly in practice is still not fully accomplished. The SWAMP project develops an IoT-based smart water management platform for precision irrigation in agriculture with a hands-on approach based on four pilots in Brazil and Europe. This paper presents the SWAMP architecture, platform, and system deployments that highlight the replicability of the platform, and, as scalability is a major concern for IoT applications, it includes a performance analysis of FIWARE components used in the Platform. Results show that it is able to provide adequate performance for the SWAMP pilots, but requires specially designed configurations and the re-engineering of some components to provide higher scalability using less computational resources.",

      "title": "IoT Goes Nuclear: Creating a ZigBee Chain Reaction",
      "abstract": "Within the next few years, billions of IoT devices will densely populate our cities. In this paper we describe a new type of threat in which adjacent IoT devices will infect each other with a worm that will rapidly spread over large areas, provided that the density of compatible IoT devices exceeds a certain critical mass. In particular, we developed and verified such an infection using the popular Philips Hue smart lamps as a platform. The worm spreads by jumping directly from one lamp to its neighbors, using only their built-in ZigBee wireless connectivity and their physical proximity. The attack can start by plugging in a single infected bulb anywhere in the city, and then catastrophically spread everywhere within minutes. It enables the attacker to turn all the city lights on or off, to permanently brick them, or to exploit them in a massive DDOS attack. To demonstrate the risks involved, we use results from percolation theory to estimate the critical mass of installed devices for a typical city such as Paris whose area is about 105 square kilometers: The chain reaction will fizzle if there are fewer than about 15,000 randomly located smart lamps in the whole city, but will spread everywhere when the number exceeds this critical mass (which had almost certainly been surpassed already). To make such an attack possible, we had to find a way to remotely yank already installed lamps from their current networks, and to perform over-the-air firmware updates. We overcame the first problem by discovering and exploiting a major bug in the implementation of the Touchlink part of the ZigBee Light Link protocol, which is supposed to stop such attempts with a proximity test. To solve the second problem, we developed a new version of a side channel attack to extract the global AES-CCM key (for each device type) that Philips uses to encrypt and authenticate new firmware. We used only readily available equipment costing a few hundred dollars, and managed to find this key without seeing any actual updates. This demonstrates once again how difficult it is to get security right even for a large company that uses standard cryptographic techniques to protect a major product.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things is increasingly becoming a ubiquitous computing service, requiring huge volumes of data storage and processing. Unfortunately, due to the unique characteristics of resource constraints, self-organization, and shortrange communication in IoT, it always resorts to the cloud for outsourced storage and computation, which has brought about a series of new challenging security and privacy threats. In this article, we introduce the architecture and unique security and privacy requirements for the next generation mobile technologies on cloud-based IoT, identify the inappropriateness of most existing work, and address the challenging issues of secure packet forwarding and efficient privacy preserving authentication by proposing new efficient privacy preserving data aggregation without public key homomorphic encryption. Finally, several interesting open problems are suggested with promising ideas to trigger more research efforts in this emerging area.",

      "abstract": "The cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) develops rapidly but suffer from large latency and backhaul bandwidth requirement, the technology of fog computing and caching has emerged as a promising paradigm for IoT to provide proximity services, and thus reduce service latency and save backhaul bandwidth. However, the performance of the fog-enabled IoT depends on the intelligent and efficient management of various network resources, and consequently the synergy of caching, computing, and communications becomes the big challenge. This paper simultaneously tackles the issues of content caching strategy, computation offloading policy, and radio resource allocation, and propose a joint optimization solution for the fog-enabled IoT. Since wireless signals and service requests have stochastic properties, we use the actor\u2013critic reinforcement learning framework to solve the joint decision-making problem with the objective of minimizing the average end-to-end delay. The deep neural network (DNN) is employed as the function approximator to estimate the value functions in the critic part due to the extremely large state and action space in our problem. The actor part uses another DNN to represent a parameterized stochastic policy and improves the policy with the help of the critic. Furthermore, the Natural policy gradient method is used to avoid converging to the local maximum. Using the numerical simulations, we demonstrate the learning capacity of the proposed algorithm and analyze the end-to-end service latency.",

      "title": "IoTGuard: Dynamic Enforcement of Security and Safety Policy in Commodity IoT",
      "abstract": "Broadly defined as the Internet of Things (IoT), the growth of commodity devices that integrate physical processes with digital connectivity has changed the way we live, play, and work. To date, the traditional approach to securing IoT has treated devices individually. However, in practice, it has been recently shown that the interactions among devices are often the real cause of safety and security violations. In this paper, we present IOTGUARD, a dynamic, policy-based enforcement system for IoT, which protects users from unsafe and insecure device states by monitoring the behavior of IoT and triggeraction platform apps. IOTGUARD operates in three phases: (a) implementation of a code instrumentor that adds extra logic to an app\u2019s source code to collect app\u2019s information at runtime, (b) storing the apps\u2019 information in a dynamic model that represents the runtime execution behavior of apps, and (c) identifying IoT safety and security policies, and enforcing relevant policies on the dynamic model of individual apps or sets of interacting apps. We demonstrate IOTGUARD on 20 flawed apps and find that IOTGUARD correctly enforces 12 of the 12 policy violations. In addition, we evaluate IOTGUARD on 35 SmartThings IoT and 30 IFTTT trigger-action platform market apps executed in a simulated smart home. IOTGUARD enforces 11 unique policies and blocks 16 states in six (17.1%) SmartThings and five (16.6%) IFTTT apps. IOTGUARD imposes only 17.3% runtime overhead on an app and 19.8% for five interacting apps. Through this effort, we introduce a rigorously grounded system for enforcing correct operation of IoT devices through systematically identified IoT policies, demonstrating the effectiveness and value of monitoring IoT apps with tools such as IOTGUARD.",

The infrastructure leverages cognitive fog nodes at the edge to host and process offloaded geo-tagged multimedia payload and transactions from a mobile edge and IoT nodes, uses AI for processing and extracting significant event information, produces semantic digital analytics, and saves results in Blockchain and decentralized cloud repositories to facilitate sharing economy services. The framework offers a sustainable incentive mechanism, which can potentially support secure smart city services, such as sharing economy, smart contracts, and cyber-physical interaction with Blockchain and IoT.

      "title": "EdgeChain: An Edge-IoT Framework and Prototype Based on Blockchain and Smart Contracts",
      "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is facing significant scalability and security challenges. On one hand, IoT devices are \u201cweak\u201d and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively \u201cvulnerable\u201d facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named \u201cEdgeChain\u201d based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or \u201ccoin\u201d system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device\u2019 account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on predefined rules on priority, application types, and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a nondeniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range.",

      "abstract": "Advances in information and communication technologies have led to the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT). In the modern health care environment, the usage of IoT technologies brings convenience of physicians and patients, since they are applied to various medical areas (such as real-time monitoring, patient information management, and healthcare management). The body sensor network (BSN) technology is one of the core technologies of IoT developments in healthcare system, where a patient can be monitored using a collection of tiny-powered and lightweight wireless sensor nodes. However, the development of this new technology in healthcare applications without considering security makes patient privacy vulnerable. In this paper, at first, we highlight the major security requirements in BSN-based modern healthcare system. Subsequently, we propose a secure IoT-based healthcare system using BSN, called BSN-Care, which can efficiently accomplish those requirements.",

      "title": "A Supervised Intrusion Detection System for Smart Home IoT Devices",
      "abstract": "The proliferation in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, which routinely collect sensitive information, is demonstrated by their prominence in our daily lives. Although such devices simplify and automate every day tasks, they also introduce tremendous security flaws. Current insufficient security measures employed to defend smart devices make IoT the \u201cweakest\u201d link to breaking into a secure infrastructure, and therefore an attractive target to attackers. This paper proposes a three layer intrusion detection system (IDS) that uses a supervised approach to detect a range of popular network based cyber-attacks on IoT networks. The system consists of three main functions: 1) classify the type and profile the normal behavior of each IoT device connected to the network; 2) identifies malicious packets on the network when an attack is occurring; and 3) classifies the type of the attack that has been deployed. The system is evaluated within a smart home testbed consisting of eight popular commercially available devices. The effectiveness of the proposed IDS architecture is evaluated by deploying 12 attacks from 4 main network based attack categories, such as denial of service (DoS), man-in-the-middle (MITM)/spoofing, reconnaissance, and replay. Additionally, the system is also evaluated against four scenarios of multistage attacks with complex chains of events. The performance of the system\u2019s three core functions result in an ${F}$ -measure of: 1) 96.2%; 2) 90.0%; and 3) 98.0%. This demonstrates that the proposed architecture can automatically distinguish between IoT devices on the network, whether network activity is malicious or benign, and detect which attack was deployed on which device connected to the network successfully.",

      "abstract": "With the sharp increase in the number of intelligent devices, the Internet of Things (IoT) has gained more and more attention and rapid development in recent years. It effectively integrates the physical world with the Internet over existing network infrastructure to facilitate sharing data among intelligent devices. However, its complex and large-scale network structure brings new security risks and challenges to IoT systems. To ensure the security of data, traditional access control technologies are not suitable to be directly used for implementing access control in IoT systems because of their complicated access management and the lack of credibility due to centralization. In this paper, we proposed a novel attribute-based access control scheme for IoT systems, which simplifies greatly the access management. We use blockchain technology to record the distribution of attributes in order to avoid single point failure and data tampering. The access control process has also been optimized to meet the need for high efficiency and lightweight calculation for IoT devices. The security and performance analysis show that our scheme could effectively resist multiple attacks and be efficiently implemented in IoT systems.",

      "abstract": "Device authentication is an essential security feature for Internet of Things (IoT). Many IoT devices are deployed in the open and public places, which makes them vulnerable to physical and cloning attacks. Therefore, any authentication protocol designed for IoT devices should be robust even in cases when an IoT device is captured by an adversary. Moreover, many of the IoT devices have limited storage and computational capabilities. Hence, it is desirable that the security solutions for IoT devices should be computationally efficient. To address all these requirements, in this paper, we present a lightweight and privacy-preserving two-factor authentication scheme for IoT devices, where physically uncloneable functions have been considered as one of the authentication factors. Security and performance analysis show that our proposed scheme is not only robust against several attacks, but also very efficient in terms of computational efficiently.",

      "title": "Choice of effective messaging protocols for IoT systems: MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and HTTP",
      "abstract": "The standard and real-time communication technology is an unalloyed inevitability for the development of Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, the selection of a standard and effective messaging protocol is a challenging and daunting task for any organisation because it depends on the nature of the IoT system and its messaging requirements. Copious messaging protocols have been developed and employed by various organisations based on their requirements in the last two decades. Though, none of them is able to support all messaging requirements of all types of IoT systems. Messaging protocol is an ongoing dilemma for the IoT industry; consequently, it is important to understand the pros and cons of the widely accepted and emerging messaging protocols for IoT systems to determine their best-fit scenarios. Therefore, this paper presents an evaluation of the four established messaging protocols MQTT, CoAP, AMQP and HTTP for IoT systems. Firstly, it presents the broad comparison among these messaging protocols to introduce their characteristics comparatively. Afterwards, it performs a further in-depth and relative analysis based on some interrelated criteria to gain insight into their strengths and limitations. Thus, based on this detailed evaluation, the user can decide their appropriate usage in various IoT systems according to their requirements and suitability.",

      "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is the future of the Internet, where everything will be connected. Studies have revealed that fog/edge computing-based services will play a major role in extending the cloud by carrying out intermediary services at the edge of the network. Fog/edge computing-based IoT\u2019s (FECIoT) distributed architecture enhances service provisioning along the Cloud-to-Things continuum, thereby making it suitable for mission-critical applications. Furthermore, the proximity of fog/edge devices to where the data is produced makes it stand-out in terms of resource allocation, service delivery, and privacy. From the business perspective, FECIoT will lead to a boom and spring up of small-to-medium-sized enterprises, thereby encouraging inclusion for all. To this end, we present a comprehensive survey on state-of-the-art IoT literature over the period 2008\u20132018 and propose the FECIoT framework which covers the enabling technologies, services, and open research issues. A tutorial approach is employed, progressing from basic to more advanced concepts within the IoT domain. Lastly, we show how FECIoT can be deployed in real-life cyber-physical systems, such as the intelligent transportation system, smart grid, smart health-care, smart homes, and smart environment.",

      "title": "Smart Home-based IoT for Real-time and Secure Remote Health Monitoring of Triage and Priority System using Body Sensors: Multi-driven Systematic Review",
      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has been identified in various applications across different domains, such as in the healthcare sector. IoT has also been recognised for its revolution in reshaping modern healthcare with aspiring wide range prospects, including economical, technological and social. This study aims to establish IoT-based smart home security solutions for real-time health monitoring technologies in telemedicine architecture. A multilayer taxonomy is driven and conducted in this study. In the first layer, a comprehensive analysis on telemedicine, which focuses on the client and server sides, shows that other studies associated with IoT-based smart home applications have several limitations that remain unaddressed. Particularly, remote patient monitoring in healthcare applications presents various facilities and benefits by adopting IoT-based smart home technologies without compromising the security requirements and potentially large number of risks. An extensive search is conducted to identify articles that handle these issues, related applications are comprehensively reviewed and a coherent taxonomy for these articles is established. A total number of (n\u2009=\u20093064) are gathered between 2007 and 2017 for most reliable databases, such as ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineer Xplore databases. Then, the articles based on IoT studies that are associated with telemedicine applications are filtered. Nine articles are selected and classified into two categories. The first category, which accounts for 22.22% (n\u2009=\u20092/9), includes surveys on telemedicine articles and their applications. The second category, which accounts for 77.78% (n\u2009=\u20097/9), includes articles on the client and server sides of telemedicine architecture. The collected studies reveal the essential requirement in constructing another taxonomy layer and review IoT-based smart home security studies. Therefore, IoT-based smart home security features are introduced and analysed in the second layer. The security of smart home design based on IoT applications is an aspect that represents a crucial matter for general occupants of smart homes, in which studies are required to provide a better solution with patient security, privacy protection and security of users\u2019 entities from being stolen or compromised. Innovative technologies have dispersed limitations related to this matter. The existing gaps and trends in this area should be investigated to provide valuable visions for technical environments and researchers. Thus, 67 articles are obtained in the second layer of our taxonomy and are classified into six categories. In the first category, 25.37% (n\u2009=\u200917/67) of the articles focus on architecture design. In the second category, 17.91% (n\u2009=\u200912/67) includes security analysis articles that investigate the research status in the security area of IoT-based smart home applications. In the third category, 10.44% (n\u2009=\u20097/67) includes articles about security schemes. In the fourth category, 17.91% (n\u2009=\u200912/67) comprises security examination. In the fifth category, 13.43% (n\u2009=\u20099/67) analyses security protocols. In the final category, 14.92% (n\u2009=\u200910/67) analyses the security framework. Then, the identified basic characteristics of this emerging field are presented and provided in the following aspects. Open challenges experienced on the development of IoT-based smart home security are addressed to be adopted fully in telemedicine applications. Then, the requirements are provided to increase researcher\u2019s interest in this study area. On this basis, a number of recommendations for different parties are described to provide insights on the next steps that should be considered to enhance the security of smart homes based on IoT. A map matching for both taxonomies is developed in this study to determine the novel risks and benefits of IoT-based smart home security for real-time remote health monitoring within client and server sides in telemedicine applications.",

      "abstract": "Information-centric networking (ICN) is being realized as a promising approach to accomplish the shortcomings of current Internet protocol-address-based networking. ICN models are based on naming the content to get rid of address-space scarcity, accessing the content via name-based-routing, and caching the content at intermediate nodes to provide reliable, efficient data delivery, and self-certifying contents to ensure better security. Obvious benefits of ICN in terms of fast and efficient data delivery and improved reliability raises ICN as highly promising networking model for Internet of Things (IoT) like environments. IoT aims to connect anyone and/or anything at any time by any path on any place. From last decade, IoT attracts both industry and research communities. IoT is an emerging research field and still in its infancy. Thus, this paper presents the potential of ICN for IoT by providing state-of-the-art literature survey. We discuss briefly the feasibility of ICN features and their models (and architectures) in the context of IoT. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive survey on ICN-based caching, naming, security, and mobility approaches for IoT with appropriate classification. Furthermore, we present operating systems and simulation tools for ICN-IoT. Finally, we provide important research challenges and issues faced by ICN for IoT.",

      "abstract": "Over the last few years, the convincing forward steps in the development of Internet of Things (IoT)-enabling solutions are spurring the advent of novel and fascinating applications. Among others, mainly radio frequency identification (RFID), wireless sensor network (WSN), and smart mobile technologies are leading this evolutionary trend. In the wake of this tendency, this paper proposes a novel, IoT-aware, smart architecture for automatic monitoring and tracking of patients, personnel, and biomedical devices within hospitals and nursing institutes. Staying true to the IoT vision, we propose a smart hospital system (SHS), which relies on different, yet complementary, technologies, specifically RFID, WSN, and smart mobile, interoperating with each other through a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP)/IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/representational state transfer (REST) network infrastructure. The SHS is able to collect, in real time, both environmental conditions and patients' physiological parameters via an ultra-low-power hybrid sensing network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a control center where an advanced monitoring application (MA) makes them easily accessible by both local and remote users via a REST web service. The simple proof of concept implemented to validate the proposed SHS has highlighted a number of key capabilities and aspects of novelty, which represent a significant step forward compared to the actual state of the art.",

      "abstract": "Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a radio access technology standardized by the 3GPP to support a large set of use cases for massive machine-type communications. Compared to human-oriented 4G technologies, NB-IoT has key design features in terms of increased coverage, enhanced power saving, and a reduced set of functionalities. These features allow for connectivity of devices in challenging positions, enabling long battery life and reducing device complexity. This article provides a detailed overview on NB-IoT, together with analysis and performance evaluation of the technology. Both uplink and downlink directions are presented, including recent updates on the support of multicast transmissions. The article summarizes the possible configurations of NB-IoT, discusses the procedures for data transmission and reception, and analyzes aspects such as latency and resource occupation. We present a performance evaluation focusing on both uplink and downlink, with the aim to understand the channel occupancy of NB-IoT for different real-life IoT use cases and cell deployments. Further analysis focuses on the impact of various radio access parameters on the capacity of NB-IoT. Finally, results focusing on a new use case for NB-IoT (i.e., firmware update of a group of devices) are presented in the form of a comparison between unicast and multicast transmission modes.",

      "title": "Design and Implementation of an Integrated IoT Blockchain Platform for Sensing Data Integrity",
      "abstract": "With the rapid development of communication technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) is getting out of its infancy, into full maturity, and tends to be developed in an explosively rapid way, with more and more data transmitted and processed. As a result, the ability to manage devices deployed worldwide has been given more and advanced requirements in practical application performances. Most existing IoT platforms are highly centralized architectures, which suffer from various technical limitations, such as a cyber-attack and single point of failure. A new solution direction is essential to enhance data accessing, while regulating it with government mandates in privacy and security. In this paper, we propose an integrated IoT platform using blockchain technology to guarantee sensing data integrity. The aim of this platform is to afford the device owner a practical application that provides a comprehensive, immutable log and allows easy access to their devices deployed in different domains. It also provides characteristics of general IoT systems, allows for real-time monitoring, and control between the end user and device. The business logic of the application is defined by the smart contract, which contains rules and conditions. The proposed approach is backed by a proof of concept implementation in realistic IoT scenarios, utilizing Raspberry Pi devices and a permissioned network called Hyperledger Fabric. Lastly, a benchmark study using various performance metrics is made to highlight the significance of the proposed work. The analysis results indicate that the designed platform is suitable for the resource-constrained IoT architecture and is scalable to be extended in various IoT scenarios.",

      "title": "Impact of internet of things (IoT) in disaster management: a task-technology fit perspective",
      "abstract": "Disaster management aims to mitigate the potential damage from the disasters, ensure immediate and suitable assistance to the victims, and attain effective and rapid recovery. These objectives require a planned and effective rescue operation post such disasters. Different types of information about the impact of the disaster are, hence, required for planning an effective and immediate relief operation. The IoT technology available today is quite mature and has the potential to be very useful in disaster situations. This paper analyzes the requirements for planning rescue operation for such natural disasters and proposes an IoT based solution to cater the identified requirements. The proposed solution is further validated using the task-technology fit (TTF) approach for analyzing the significance of the adoption of IoT technology for disaster management. Results from the exploratory study established the core dimensions of the task requirements and the TTF constructs. Results from the confirmatory factor analysis using PLS path modelling, further, suggest that both task requirements and IoT technology have significant impact on the IoT TTF in the disaster management scenario. This paper makes significant contributions in the development of appropriate constructs for modeling TTF for IoT Technology in the context of disaster management.",

      "abstract": "Mobile edge computing helps healthcare Internet of Things (IoT) devices with energy harvesting provide satisfactory quality of experiences for computation intensive applications. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based privacy-aware offloading scheme to help healthcare IoT devices protect both the user location privacy and the usage pattern privacy. More specifically, this scheme enables a healthcare IoT device to choose the offloading rate that improves the computation performance, protects user privacy, and saves the energy of the IoT device without being aware of the privacy leakage, IoT energy consumption, and edge computation model. This scheme uses transfer learning to reduce the random exploration at the initial learning process and applies a Dyna architecture that provides simulated offloading experiences to accelerate the learning process. A post-decision state learning method uses the known channel state model to further improve the offloading performance. We provide the performance bound of this scheme regarding the privacy level, the energy consumption, and the computation latency for three typical healthcare IoT offloading scenarios. Simulation results show that this scheme can reduce the computation latency, save the energy consumption, and improve the privacy level of the healthcare IoT device compared with the benchmark scheme.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is facing the shortage of spectrum resources due to the rapid growth of IoT terminals and big data services. Fifth generation (5G) network owns sufficient spectrum resources and supplies large data volume business, which can help to expand the communication resources of the IoT by combing IoT with 5G network. In this paper, a 5G-based IoT is designed to transfer both 5G and IoT information simultaneously. Two simultaneous transfer models including time switching model and power splitting model are proposed to carry out 5G and IoT communications using different time slots and power streams, respectively. For these two models, we have formulated joint optimization problem of allocation factors and node powers to maximize the 5G transmission rate while the IoT transmission rate and the total power are constrained. An alternative optimization problem is also proposed to maximize the IoT transmission rate while guaranteeing the minimal 5G transmission rate. A joint optimization algorithm based on the Lagrange dual optimization is proposed to obtain the solution to the optimization problems. An energy efficiency model is proposed to minimize the consumed total power of the IoT while keeping the minimal 5G and IoT transmission rates. Simulation results are given to evaluate the performance of our proposed models from diverse perspectives.",

      "title": "Making Knowledge Tradable in Edge-AI Enabled IoT: A Consortium Blockchain-Based Efficient and Incentive Approach",
      "abstract": "Nowadays, benefit from more powerful edge computing devices and edge artificial intelligence (edge-AI) could be introduced into Internet of Things (IoT) to find the knowledge derived from massive sensory data, such as cyber results or models of classification, and detection and prediction from physical environments. Heterogeneous edge-AI devices in IoT will generate isolated and distributed knowledge slices, thus knowledge collaboration and exchange are required to complete complex tasks in IoT intelligent applications with numerous selfish nodes. Therefore, knowledge trading is needed for paid sharing in edge-AI enabled IoT. Most existing works only focus on knowledge generation rather than trading in IoT. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) knowledge market to make knowledge tradable in edge-AI enabled IoT. We first propose an implementation architecture of the knowledge market. Moreover, we develop a knowledge consortium blockchain for secure and efficient knowledge management and trading for the market, which includes a new cryptographic currency knowledge coin, smart contracts, and a new consensus mechanism proof of trading. Besides, a noncooperative game based knowledge pricing strategy with incentives for the market is also proposed. The security analysis and performance simulation show the security and efficiency of our knowledge market and incentive effects of knowledge pricing strategy. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to propose an efficient and incentive P2P knowledge market in edge-AI enabled IoT.",

      "abstract": "A transformation is underway in electric power and energy systems (EPESs) to provide clean distributed energy for sustainable global economic growth. Internet of Things (IoT) is at the forefront of this transformation imparting capabilities, such as real-time monitoring, situational awareness and intelligence, control, and cyber security to transform the existing EPES into intelligent cyber-enabled EPES, which is more efficient, secure, reliable, resilient, and sustainable. Additionally, digitizing the electric power ecosystem using IoT improves asset visibility, optimal management of distributed generation, eliminates energy wastage, and create savings. IoT has a significant impact on EPESs and offers several opportunities for growth and development. There are several challenges with the deployment of IoT for EPESs. Viable solutions need to be developed to overcome these challenges to ensure continued growth of IoT for EPESs. The advancements in computational intelligence capabilities can evolve an intelligent IoT system by emulating biological nervous systems with cognitive computation, streaming and distributed analytics including at the edge and device levels. This review paper provides an assessment of the role, impact and challenges of IoT in transforming EPESs.",

      "abstract": "Despite growing concerns about security and privacy of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, consumers generally do not have access to security and privacy information when purchasing these devices. We interviewed 24 participants about IoT devices they purchased. While most had not considered privacy and security prior to purchase, they reported becoming concerned later due to media reports, opinions shared by friends, or observing unexpected device behavior. Those who sought privacy and security information before purchase, reported that it was difficult or impossible to find. We asked interviewees to rank factors they would consider when purchasing IoT devices; after features and price, privacy and security were ranked among the most important. Finally, we showed interviewees our prototype privacy and security label. Almost all found it to be accessible and useful, encouraging them to incorporate privacy and security in their IoT purchase decisions.",

      "abstract": "Among the panoply of applications enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), smart and connected health care is a particularly important one. Networked sensors, either worn on the body or embedded in our living environments, make possible the gathering of rich information indicative of our physical and mental health. Captured on a continual basis, aggregated, and effectively mined, such information can bring about a positive transformative change in the health care landscape. In particular, the availability of data at hitherto unimagined scales and temporal longitudes coupled with a new generation of intelligent processing algorithms can: (a) facilitate an evolution in the practice of medicine, from the current post facto diagnose-and-treat reactive paradigm, to a proactive framework for prognosis of diseases at an incipient stage, coupled with prevention, cure, and overall management of health instead of disease, (b) enable personalization of treatment and management options targeted particularly to the specific circumstances and needs of the individual, and (c) help reduce the cost of health care while simultaneously improving outcomes. In this paper, we highlight the opportunities and challenges for IoT in realizing this vision of the future of health care.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain (BC) technologies have been dominating their respective research domains for some time. IoT offers automation at the finest level in different fields, while BC provides secure transaction processing for asset exchanges. The capability of IoT devices to generate transactions prompts their integration with BC as the next logical step. The biggest challenges in this integration are the scalability of ledger and rate of transaction execution in BC. On one hand, due to their large numbers, IoT devices will generate transactions at a rate which current block chain solutions cannot handle. On the other hand, implementing BC peers onto IoT devices is impossible due to resource constraints. This prohibits direct integration of both technologies in their current state. In this paper, we propose a solution to address these challenges by using a local peer network to bridge the gap. It restricts the number of transactions which enters the global BC by implementing a scalable local ledger, without compromising on the peer validation of transactions at local and global level. The testbed evaluations show significant reduction in the block weight and ledger size on global peers. The solution also indirectly improves the transaction processing rate of all peers due to load distribution.",

      "abstract": "In this paper we propose deep learning models for the cyber security in IoT (Internet of Things) networks. IoT network is as a promising technology which connects the living and non-living things around the world. The implementation of IoT is growing fast but the cyber security is still a loophole, so it is susceptible to many cyber-attack and for the success of any network it most important that the network is completely secure, otherwise people could be reluctant to use this technology. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack has affected many IoT networks in recent past that has resulted in huge losses. We have proposed deep learning models and evaluated those using latest CICIDS2017 datasets for DDoS attack detection which has provided highest accuracy as 97.16% also proposed models are compared with machine learning algorithms. This paper also identifies open research challenges for usage of deep learning algorithm for IoT cyber security.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) technology provides a competent and structured approach to handle service deliverance aspects of healthcare in terms of mobile health and remote patient monitoring. IoT generates an unprecedented amount of data that can be processed using cloud computing. But for real-time remote health monitoring applications, the delay caused by transferring data to the cloud and back to the application is unacceptable. Relative to this context, we proposed the remote patient health monitoring in smart homes by using the concept of fog computing at the smart gateway. The proposed model uses advanced techniques and services, such as embedded data mining, distributed storage, and notification services at the edge of the network. Event triggering-based data transmission methodology is adopted to process the patient\u2019s real-time data at fog layer. Temporal mining concept is used to analyze the events adversity by calculating the temporal health index of the patient. In order to determine the validity of the system, health data of 67 patients in IoT-based smart home environment was systematically generated for 30 days. Results depict that the proposed Bayesian belief network classifier-based model has high accuracy and response time in determining the state of an event when compared with other classification algorithms. Moreover, decision making based on real-time healthcare data further enhances the utility of the proposed system.",

In this paper, we introduce a general framework for IoT-fog-cloud applications, and propose a delay-minimizing collaboration and offloading policy for fog-capable devices that aims to reduce the service delay for IoT applications.

      "abstract": "The increasing population in the world forces humans to improve farm yields using advanced technologies. The Internet of Things (IoT) is one promising technique to achieve precision agriculture, which is expected to greatly increase yields. However, the large-scale application of IoT systems in agriculture is facing challenges such as huge investment in agriculture IoT systems and non-tech-savvy farmers. To identify these challenges, we summarize the applications of IoT techniques in agriculture in four categories: controlled environment planting, open-field planting, livestock breeding, and aquaculture and aquaponics. The focus on implementing agriculture IoT systems is suggested to be expanded from the growth cycle to the agri-products life cycle. Meanwhile, the energy concern should be considered in the implementation of agriculture IoT systems. The construction of green IoT systems in the whole life cycle of agri-products will have great impact on farmers' interest in IoT techniques. With the life cycle framework, emerging finance, operation, and management (FOM) issues in the implementation of green IoT systems in agriculture are observed, such as IoT finance, supply chain and big data financing, network nodes recharging and repairing, and IoT data management. These FOM issues call for innovative farm production modes and new types of agribusiness enterprises.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) have enabled myriad domains such as smart homes, personal monitoring devices, and enhanced manufacturing. IoT is now pervasive\u2014new applications are being used in nearly every conceivable environment, which leads to the adoption of device-based interaction and automation. However, IoT has also raised issues about the security and privacy of these digitally augmented spaces. Program analysis is crucial in identifying those issues, yet the application and scope of program analysis in IoT remains largely unexplored by the technical community. In this article, we study privacy and security issues in IoT that require program-analysis techniques with an emphasis on identified attacks against these systems and defenses implemented so far. Based on a study of five IoT programming platforms, we identify the key insights that result from research efforts in both the program analysis and security communities and relate the efficacy of program-analysis techniques to security and privacy issues. We conclude by studying recent IoT analysis systems and exploring their implementations. Through these explorations, we highlight key challenges and opportunities in calibrating for the environments in which IoT systems will be used.",

The security and privacy are some of the critical issues related to the wide application of IoT. Therefore, these issues prevent the wide adoption of the IoT. In this paper, we are presenting an overview about different layered architectures of IoT and attacks regarding security from the perspective of layers.

      "abstract": "In recent years, the wide adoption of the modern Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has led to the invention of smart cities. Smart cities operate in real-world time to promote ease and quality of life in urban cities. The network traffic of a smart city via IoT systems is growing exponentially and introducing new cybersecurity challenges since these IoT devices are being connected to sensors that are directly connected to massive cloud servers. In order to mitigate these cyberattacks, the developers need to enhance new techniques for detecting infected IoT devices. In this paper, to address the IoT cybersecurity threats in a smart city, we propose an Anomaly Detection-IoT (AD-IoT) system, which is an intelligent anomaly detection based on Random Forest machine learning algorithm. The proposed solution can effectively detect compromised IoT devices at distributed fog nodes. To evaluate our model, we utilized modern dataset to illustrate the model\u2019s accuracy. Our findings show that the AD-IoT can effectively achieve highest classification accuracy of 99.34% with lowest false positive rate.",

      "title": "Hierarchical Fog-Cloud Computing for IoT Systems: A Computation Offloading Game",
      "abstract": "Fog computing, which provides low-latency computing services at the network edge, is an enabler for the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this paper, we study the allocation of fog computing resources to the IoT users in a hierarchical computing paradigm including fog and remote cloud computing services. We formulate a computation offloading game to model the competition between IoT users and allocate the limited processing power of fog nodes efficiently. Each user aims to maximize its own quality of experience (QoE), which reflects its satisfaction of using computing services in terms of the reduction in computation energy and delay. Utilizing a potential game approach, we prove the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium (NE) and provide an upper bound for the price of anarchy. Since the time complexity to reach the equilibrium increases exponentially in the number of users, we further propose a near-optimal resource allocation mechanism and prove that in a system with <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${N}$ </tex-math></inline-formula> IoT users, it achieves an <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$\\epsilon$ </tex-math></inline-formula>-NE in <inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${O}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>(<inline-formula> <tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">${N}/\\epsilon$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) time. Through numerical studies, we evaluate the users\u2019 QoE as well as the equilibrium efficiency. Our results reveal that by utilizing the proposed mechanism, more users benefit from computing services in comparison to an existing offloading mechanism. We further show that our proposed mechanism significantly reduces the computation delay and enables low-latency fog computing services for delay-sensitive IoT applications.",

      "title": "A Secure and Efficient Lightweight Symmetric Encryption Scheme for Transfer of Text Files between Embedded IoT Devices",
      "abstract": "Recent advancements in wireless technology have created an exponential rise in the number of connected devices leading to the internet of things (IoT) revolution. Large amounts of data are captured, processed and transmitted through the network by these embedded devices. Security of the transmitted data is a major area of concern in IoT networks. Numerous encryption algorithms have been proposed in these years to ensure security of transmitted data through the IoT network. Tiny encryption algorithm (TEA) is the most attractive among all, with its lower memory utilization and ease of implementation on both hardware and software scales. But one of the major issues of TEA and its numerous developed versions is the usage of the same key through all rounds of encryption, which yields a reduced security evident from the avalanche effect of the algorithm. Also, the encryption and decryption time for text is high, leading to lower efficiency in IoT networks with embedded devices. This paper proposes a novel tiny symmetric encryption algorithm (NTSA) which provides enhanced security for the transfer of text files through the IoT network by introducing additional key confusions dynamically for each round of encryption. Experiments are carried out to analyze the avalanche effect, encryption and decryption time of NTSA in an IoT network including embedded devices. The results show that the proposed NTSA algorithm is much more secure and efficient compared to state-of-the-art existing encryption algorithms.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the research in generic Internet of Things (IoT) attracts a lot of practical applications including smart home, smart city, smart grid, industrial Internet, connected healthcare, smart retail, smart supply chain and smart farming. The hierarchical IoT network (HIoTN) is a special kind of the generic IoT network, which is composed of the different nodes, such as the gateway node, cluster head nodes, and sensing nodes organized in a hierarchy. In HIoTN, there is a need, where a user can directly access the real-time data from the sensing nodes for a particular application in generic IoT networking environment. This paper emphasizes on the design of a new secure lightweight three-factor remote user authentication scheme for HIoTNs, called the user authenticated key management protocol (UAKMP). The three factors used in UAKMP are the user smart card, password, and personal biometrics. The security of the scheme is thoroughly analyzed under the formal security in the widely accepted real-or-random model, the informal security as well as the formal security verification using the widely accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool. UAKMP offers several functionality features including offline sensing node registration, freely password and biometric update facility, user anonymity, and sensing node anonymity compared to other related existing schemes. In addition, UAKMP is also comparable in computation and communication costs as compared to other existing schemes.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm focusing on the connection of devices, objects, or \u201cthings\u201d to each other, to the Internet, and to users. IoT technology is anticipated to become an essential requirement in the development of smart homes, as it offers convenience and efficiency to home residents so that they can achieve better quality of life. Application of the IoT model to smart homes, by connecting objects to the Internet, poses new security and privacy challenges in terms of the confidentiality, authenticity, and integrity of the data sensed, collected, and exchanged by the IoT objects. These challenges make smart homes extremely vulnerable to different types of security attacks, resulting in IoT-based smart homes being insecure. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the possible security risks to develop a complete picture of the security status of smart homes. This article applies the operationally critical threat, asset, and vulnerability evaluation (OCTAVE) methodology, known as OCTAVE Allegro, to assess the security risks of smart homes. The OCTAVE Allegro method focuses on information assets and considers different information containers such as databases, physical papers, and humans. The key goals of this study are to highlight the various security vulnerabilities of IoT-based smart homes, to present the risks on home inhabitants, and to propose approaches to mitigating the identified risks. The research findings can be used as a foundation for improving the security requirements of IoT-based smart homes.",

However, with the explosively emerging mobile IoT services, malicious attackers can access them in an unauthorized way. In this paper, we designed an Efficient Anonymous User Authentication (E-AUA) protocol between the users and servers based on multiserver architectures, which contain multiple servers to address the problem of network congestion in mobile IoT. Furthermore, the E-AUA protocol was designed with a dual messages mechanism with strong anti-attack ability, lower communication and computation costs. Comparing with the state of the art protocols, our E-AUA protocol reduced both communication and computation costs. We also provided a security analysis to demonstrate that our E-AUA protocol is secure and meets a variety of security requirements in a motivated mobile IoT scenario.",

      "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe purpose of this paper is to identify, analyze and model Internet of Things (IoT) enablers essential for the success of Industry 4.0.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nIoT enablers for Industry 4.0 are identified from literature and inferable discussions with industry experts. Three different techniques namely, principal component analysis (PCA), interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) are applied to model IoT enablers. In addition to this, DEMATEL is also applied under two different situations representing the behavioral characteristic of experts involved. These are termed as optimistic (maximum) and pessimistic (minimum).\n\n\nFindings\nThe integrated approach of PCA-ISM-DEMATEL shows that IoT ecosystem and IoT Big Data are the most influential or driving IoT enablers. These two enablers have been identified as the pillars for Industry 4.0. On the other side, IoT interchangeability, consumer IoT, IoT robustness and IoT interface and network capability have also been identified as the most dependent enablers for Industry 4.0.\n\n\nPractical implications\nThe findings enable the industry practitioners to select the most appropriate driving enablers for an effective implementation of Industry 4.0.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe integrated approach-based hierarchical model and cause-effect relationship among IoT enablers are proposed which is a novel initiative for Industry 4.0. Moreover, two different variants of DEMATEL namely, pessimistic and optimistic are applied first time.\n",

      "abstract": "The future Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to enable a new and wide range of decentralized systems (from small-scale smart homes to large-scale smart cities) in which \u201cthings\u201d are able to sense/actuate, compute, and communicate, and thus play a central and crucial role. The growing importance of such novel networked cyber-physical context demands suitable and effective computing paradigms to fulfill the various requirements of IoT systems engineering. In this paper, we propose to explore an agent-based computing paradigm to support IoT systems analysis, design, and implementation. The synergic meeting of agents with IoT makes it possible to develop smart and dynamic IoT systems of diverse scales. Our agent-oriented approach is specifically based on the agent-based cooperating smart object (ACOSO) methodology and on the related ACOSO middleware: they provide effective agent design and programming models along with efficient tools for the actual construction of an IoT system in terms of a multiagent system. A case study concerning the development of a complex IoT system, namely a Smart University Campus, is described to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Smart home Internet of Things (IoT) devices are rapidly increasing in popularity, with more households including Internet-connected devices that continuously monitor user activities. In this study, we conduct eleven semi-structured interviews with smart home owners, investigating their reasons for purchasing IoT devices, perceptions of smart home privacy risks, and actions taken to protect their privacy from those external to the home who create, manage, track, or regulate IoT devices and/or their data. We note several recurring themes. First, users' desires for convenience and connectedness dictate their privacy-related behaviors for dealing with external entities, such as device manufacturers, Internet Service Providers, governments, and advertisers. Second, user opinions about external entities collecting smart home data depend on perceived benefit from these entities. Third, users trust IoT device manufacturers to protect their privacy but do not verify that these protections are in place. Fourth, users are unaware of privacy risks from inference algorithms operating on data from non-audio/visual devices. These findings motivate several recommendations for device designers, researchers, and industry standards to better match device privacy features to the expectations and preferences of smart home owners.",

      "abstract": "The low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, which is now embracing a booming era with the development in the Internet of Things (IoT), may offer a brand new solution for current smart grid communications due to their excellent features of low power, long range, and high capacity. The mission-critical smart grid communications require secure and reliable connections between the utilities and the devices with high quality of service (QoS). This is difficult to achieve for unlicensed LPWAN technologies due to the crowded license-free band. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), as a licensed LPWAN technology, is developed based on the existing long-term evolution specifications and facilities. Thus, it is able to provide cellular-level QoS, and henceforth can be viewed as a promising candidate for smart grid communications. In this paper, we introduce NB-IoT to the smart grid and compare it with the existing representative communication technologies in the context of smart grid communications in terms of data rate, latency, range, etc. The overall requirements of communications in the smart grid from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives are comprehensively investigated and each of them is carefully examined for NB-IoT. We further explore the representative applications in the smart grid and analyze the corresponding feasibility of NB-IoT. Moreover, the performance of NB-IoT in typical scenarios of the smart grid communication environments, such as urban and rural areas, is carefully evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations.",

      "abstract": "As the deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) is experiencing an exponential growth, it is no surprise that many recent cyber attacks are IoT-enabled: the attacker initially exploits some vulnerable IoT technology as a first step toward compromising a critical system that is connected, in some way, with the IoT. For some sectors, like industry, smart grids, transportation, and medical services, the significance of such attacks is obvious, since IoT technologies are part of critical back-end systems. However, in sectors where IoT is usually at the end-user side, like smart homes, such attacks can be underestimated, since not all possible attack paths are examined. In this paper, we survey IoT-enabled cyber attacks, found in all application domains since 2010. For each sector, we emphasize on the latest, verified IoT-enabled attacks, based on known real-world incidents and published proof-of-concept attacks. We methodologically analyze representative attacks that demonstrate direct, indirect, and subliminal attack paths against critical targets. Our goal is threefold: 1) to assess IoT-enabled cyber attacks in a risk-like approach, in order to demonstrate their current threat landscape; 2) to identify hidden and subliminal IoT-enabled attack paths against critical infrastructures and services; and 3) to examine mitigation strategies for all application domains.",

      "abstract": "With more IoT devices entering the consumer market, it becomes imperative to detect their security vulnerabilities before an attacker does. Existing binary analysis based approaches only work on firmware, which is less accessible except for those equipped with special tools for extracting the code from the device. To address this challenge in IoT security analysis, we present in this paper a novel automatic fuzzing framework, called IOTFUZZER, which aims at finding memory corruption vulnerabilities in IoT devices without access to their firmware images. The key idea is based upon the observation that most IoT devices are controlled through their official mobile apps, and such an app often contains rich information about the protocol it uses to communicate with its device. Therefore, by identifying and reusing program-specific logic (e.g., encryption) to mutate the test case (particularly message fields), we are able to effectively probe IoT targets without relying on any knowledge about its protocol specifications. In our research, we implemented IOTFUZZER and evaluated 17 real-world IoT devices running on different protocols, and our approach successfully identified 15 memory corruption vulnerabilities (including 8 previously unknown ones).",

      "abstract": "Fog computing-enhanced Internet of Things (IoT) has recently received considerable attention, as the fog devices deployed at the network edge can not only provide low latency, location awareness but also improve real-time and quality of services in IoT application scenarios. Privacy-preserving data aggregation is one of typical fog computing applications in IoT, and many privacy-preserving data aggregation schemes have been proposed in the past years. However, most of them only support data aggregation for homogeneous IoT devices, and cannot aggregate hybrid IoT devices\u2019 data into one in some real IoT applications. To address this challenge, in this paper, we present a lightweight privacy-preserving data aggregation scheme, called Lightweight Privacy-preserving Data Aggregation, for fog computing-enhanced IoT. The proposed LPDA is characterized by employing the homomorphic Paillier encryption, Chinese Remainder Theorem, and one-way hash chain techniques to not only aggregate hybrid IoT devices\u2019 data into one, but also early filter injected false data at the network edge. Detailed security analysis shows LPDA is really secure and privacy-enhanced with differential privacy techniques. In addition, extensive performance evaluations are conducted, and the results indicate LPDA is really lightweight in fog computing-enhanced IoT.",

      "abstract": "Today the cloud plays a central role in storing, processing, and distributing data. Despite contributing to the rapid development of IoT applications, the current IoT cloud-centric architecture has led into a myriad of isolated data silos that hinders the full potential of holistic data-driven analytics within the IoT. In this paper, we present a blockchain-based design for the IoT that brings a distributed access control and data management. We depart from the current trust model that delegates access control of our data to a centralized trusted authority and instead empower the users with data ownership. Our design is tailored for IoT data streams and enables secure data sharing. We enable a secure and resilient access control management, by utilizing the blockchain as an auditable and distributed access control layer to the storage layer. We facilitate the storage of time-series IoT data at the edge of the network via a locality-aware decentralized storage system that is managed with the blockchain technology. Our system is agnostic of the physical storage nodes and supports as well utilization of cloud storage resources as storage nodes.",

      "abstract": "Fog computing aims at extending the Cloud by bringing computational power, storage, and communication capabilities to the edge of the network, in support of the IoT. Segmentation, distribution, and adaptive deployment of functionalities over the continuum from Things to Cloud are challenging tasks, due to the intrinsic heterogeneity, hierarchical structure, and very large scale infrastructure they will have to exploit. In this paper, we propose a simple, yet general, model to support the QoS-aware deployment of multicomponent IoT applications to Fog infrastructures. The model describes operational systemic qualities of the available infrastructure (latency and bandwidth), interactions among software components and Things, and business policies. Algorithms to determine eligible deployments for an application to a Fog infrastructure are presented. A Java tool, FogTorch, based on the proposed model has been prototyped.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a revolution of the Internet which can connect nearly all environment devices over the Internet to share their data to create novel services and applications for improving our quality of life. Using cheap sensors, the IoT enables various devices and objects around us to be addressable, recognizable and locatable. Although the IoT brought infinite benefits, it creates several challenges, especially in security and privacy. Handling these issues and ensuring security and privacy for IoT products and services must be a fundamental priority. Users need to trust IoT devices and related services are secure. Moreover, the IoT safety must be considered to prevent the IoT system and its components from causing an unacceptable risk of injury or physical damage and at the same time considering social behaviour and ethical use of IoT technologies to enable effective security and safety. This chapter provides a discussion of IoT security, privacy, safety and ethics. It starts by providing an overview of the IoT system, its architecture and essential characteristics. This is followed by discussing IoT security challenges, requirements and best practices to protect IoT devices. The IoT privacy is also discussed by highlighting various IoT privacy threats and solutions to preserve the privacy of IoT devices. The IoT safety, ethics, the need for the ethical design and challenges encountered are also discussed. In the end, smart cities are introduced as a case study to investigate various security threats and suggested solutions to maintain a good security level in a smart city.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting things to the Internet in a peer-to-peer paradigm for data collecting and data sharing in our daily life. A blockchain is an immutable append-only ledger maintained by a peer-to-peer network, where the whole network needs to reach a consensus on the transactional data stored on the ledger. With the decentralization nature, the design of IoT and blockchain aligns with each other well. Blockchain has been integrated with the IoT to solve the existing IoT problems. Our research focuses on analyzing the solutions proposed in academia and the methodologies used to integrate blockchain with the IoT. Through conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) on peer-reviewed, published articles on blockchain-based solutions for IoT, we gather the knowledge on current technical approaches implemented to integrate blockchain into the IoT. Majority of the research in this space is either at a conceptual level or at a very early stage. However, we only found 35 published papers with the real implementation of blockchain in the IoT platforms. We elicit the challenges of the IoT that were being addressed, and the detailed design of the blockchain-based solutions from two perspectives, namely data management and thing management. The evaluation methods and metrics used by those works are also being recorded and analyzed. In addition to the analysis of the literature, we provide our insights on improving the existing solutions and research methodology based on our expertise and experience on the blockchain.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication is a promising technology for Internet of Things (IoT) systems. In this paper, we combine UAV communication and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) for constructing high capacity IoT uplink transmission systems, where UAVs are used as aerial base stations for collecting data from IoT nodes while NOMA is invoked for uplink transmission. We aim to maximize the system capacity by jointly optimize the subchannel assignment, the uplink transmit power of IoT nodes, and the flying heights of UAVs. We commence by proposing an efficient subchannel assignment algorithm relying on the classic ${K}$ -means clustering method and matching theory. Then, we determine both the distributed uplink transmit power of IoT nodes and flying heights of UAVs based on successive optimization approach. An alternative optimization algorithm is also proposed for finding the near-optimal solutions. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme.",

However, as an emerging field of study, edge computing is still in its infancy and faces many challenges in its implementation and standardization. In this article, we study an implementation of edge computing, which exploits transparent computing to build scalable IoT platforms. Specifically, we first propose a transparent computing based IoT architecture, and clearly identify its advantages and associated challenges. Then, we present a case study to clearly show how to build scalable lightweight wearables with the proposed architecture.

      "abstract": "5G network is considered as a key enabler in meeting continuously increasing demands for the future Internet of Things (IoT) services, including high data rate, numerous devices connection, and low service latency. To satisfy these demands, network slicing and fog computing have been envisioned as the promising solutions in service-oriented 5G architecture. However, security paradigms enabling authentication and confidentiality of 5G communications for IoT services remain elusive, but indispensable. In this paper, we propose an efficient and secure service-oriented authentication framework supporting network slicing and fog computing for 5G-enabled IoT services. Specifically, users can efficiently establish connections with 5G core network and anonymously access IoT services under their delegation through proper network slices of 5G infrastructure selected by fog nodes based on the slice/service types of accessing services. The privacy-preserving slice selection mechanism is introduced to preserve both configured slice types and accessing service types of users. In addition, session keys are negotiated among users, local fogs and IoT servers to guarantee secure access of service data in fog cache and remote servers with low latency. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework through simulations to demonstrate its efficiency and feasibility under 5G infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "The rapid increase in the number and diversity of smart devices connected to the Internet has raised the issues of flexibility, efficiency, availability, security, and scalability within the current IoT network. These issues are caused by key mechanisms being distributed to the IoT network on a large scale, which is why a distributed secure SDN architecture for IoT using the blockchain technique (DistBlockNet) is proposed in this research. It follows the principles required for designing a secure, scalable, and efficient network architecture. The DistBlockNet model of IoT architecture combines the advantages of two emerging technologies: SDN and blockchains technology. In a verifiable manner, blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-confident members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary. A new scheme for updating a flow rule table using a blockchains technique is proposed to securely verify a version of the flow rule table, validate the flow rule table, and download the latest flow rules table for the IoT forwarding devices. In our proposed architecture, security must automatically adapt to the threat landscape, without administrator needs to review and apply thousands of recommendations and opinions manually. We have evaluated the performance of our proposed model architecture and compared it to the existing model with respect to various metrics. The results of our evaluation show that DistBlockNet is capable of detecting attacks in the IoT network in real time with low performance overheads and satisfying the design principles required for the future IoT network.",

      "abstract": "Campuses and cities of the near future will be equipped with vast numbers of IoT devices. Operators of such environments may not even be fully aware of their IoT assets, let alone whether each IoT device is functioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This paper proposes the use of network traffic analytics to characterize IoT devices, including their typical behaviour mode. We first collect and synthesize traffic traces from a smart-campus environment instrumented with a diversity of IoT devices including cameras, lights, appliances, and health-monitors; our traces, collected over a period of 3 weeks, are released as open data to the public. We then analyze the traffic traces to characterize statistical attributes such as data rates and burstiness, activity cycles, and signalling patterns, for over 20 IoT devices deployed in our environment. Finally, using these attributes, we develop a classification method that can not only distinguish IoT from non-IoT traffic, but also identify specific IoT devices with over 95% accuracy. Our study empowers operators of smart cities and campuses to discover and monitor their IoT assets based on their network behaviour.",

      "abstract": "The increasing popularity of specialized Internet-connected devices and appliances, dubbed the Internet-of-Things (IoT), promises both new conveniences and new privacy concerns. Unlike traditional web browsers, many IoT devices have always-on sensors that constantly monitor fine-grained details of users' physical environments and influence the devices' network communications. Passive network observers, such as Internet service providers, could potentially analyze IoT network traffic to infer sensitive details about users. Here, we examine four IoT smart home devices (a Sense sleep monitor, a Nest Cam Indoor security camera, a WeMo switch, and an Amazon Echo) and find that their network traffic rates can reveal potentially sensitive user interactions even when the traffic is encrypted. These results indicate that a technological solution is needed to protect IoT device owner privacy, and that IoT-specific concerns must be considered in the ongoing policy debate around ISP data collection and usage.",

      "title": "ContexloT: Towards Providing Contextual Integrity to Appified IoT Platforms",
      "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has quickly evolved to a new appified era where third-party developers can write apps for IoT platforms using programming frameworks. Like other appified platforms, e.g., the smartphone platform, the permission system plays an important role in platform security. However, design flaws in current IoT platform permission models have been reported recently, exposing users to significant harm such as break-ins and theft. To solve these problems, a new access control model is needed for both current and future IoT platforms. In this paper, we propose ContexIoT, a context-based permission system for appified IoT platforms that provides contextual integrity by supporting fine-grained context identification for sensitive actions, and runtime prompts with rich context information to help users perform effective access control. Context definition in ContexIoT is at the inter-procedure control and data flow levels, that we show to be more comprehensive than previous context-based permission systems for the smartphone platform. ContexIoT is designed to be backward compatible and thus can be directly adopted by current IoT platforms. We prototype ContexIoT on the Samsung SmartThings platform, with an automatic app patching mechanism developed to support unmodified commodity SmartThings apps. To evaluate the system\u2019s effectiveness, we perform the first extensive study of possible attacks on appified IoT platforms by reproducing reported IoT attacks and constructing new IoT attacks based on smartphone malware classes. We categorize these attacks based on lifecycle and adversary techniques, and build the first taxonomized IoT attack app dataset. Evaluating ContexIoT on this dataset, we find that it can effectively distinguish the attack context for all the tested apps. The performance evaluation on 283 commodity IoT apps shows that the app patching adds nearly negligible delay to the event triggering latency, and the permission request frequency is far below the threshold that is considered to risk user habituation or annoyance.",

      "abstract": "The rise of the Internet of Things (IoT) implies new technical challenges such as managing a universally vast number of IoT devices. Despite the fact that there are already a variety of secure management frameworks for IoT, they are based on centralized models, which limits their applicability in scenarios with a large number of IoT devices. In order to overcome those limitations, we have developed a distributed IoT management system based on blockchain. In this paper, we compare the performance of our solution with the existing access management solutions in IoT. We study the delays and the throughput rate associated with the systems and analyze different configurations of our solution to maximize its scalability. The objective of this paper is to find out whether our solution can scale as well as the existing management systems in IoT.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) are increasingly common in our society, and can be found in civilian settings as well as sensitive applications, such as battlefields and national security. Given the potential of these devices to be targeted by attackers, they are a valuable source in digital forensic investigations. In addition, incriminating evidence may be stored on an IoT device (e.g., Amazon Echo in a home environment and Fitbit worn by the victim or an accused person). In comparison to IoT security and privacy literature, IoT forensics is relatively under-studied. IoT forensics is also challenging in practice, particularly due to the complexity, diversity, and heterogeneity of IoT devices and ecosystems. In this paper, we present an IoT-based forensic model that supports the identification, acquisition, analysis, and presentation of potential artifacts of forensic interest from IoT devices and the underpinning infrastructure. Specifically, we use the popular Amazon Echo as a use case to demonstrate how our proposed model can be used to guide forensics analysis of IoT devices.",

      "abstract": "Blockchain (BC) in the Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel technology that acts with decentralized, distributed, public and real-time ledger to store transactions among IoT nodes. A blockchain is a series of blocks, each block is linked to its previous blocks. Every block has the cryptographic hash code, previous block hash, and its data. The transactions in BC are the basic units that are used to transfer data between IoT nodes. The IoT nodes are different kind of physical but smart devices with embedded sensors, actuators, programs and able to communicate with other IoT nodes. The role of BC in IoT is to provide a procedure to process secured records of data through IoT nodes. BC is a secured technology that can be used publicly and openly. IoT requires this kind of technology to allow secure communication among IoT nodes in heterogeneous environment. The transactions in BC could be traced and explored through anyone who are authenticated to communicate within the IoT. The BC in IoT may help to improve the communication security. In this paper, I explored this approach, its opportunities and challenges.",

      "abstract": "It is a challenge to ensure data integrity for cloud-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications because of the inherently dynamic nature of IoT data. The available frameworks of data integrity verification with public auditability cannot avoid the Third Party Auditors (TPAs). However, in a dynamic environment, such as the IoT, the reliability of the TPA-based frameworks is far from being satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based framework for Data Integrity Service. Under such framework, a more reliable data integrity verification can be provided for both the Data Owners and the Data Consumers, without relying on any Third Party Auditor (TPA). In this paper, the relevant protocols and a subsequent prototype system, which is implemented to evaluate the feasibility of our proposals, are presented. The performance evaluation of the implemented prototype system is conducted, and the test results are discussed. The work lays a foundation for our future work on dynamic data integrity verification in a fully decentralized environment.",

      "title": "Secure Signature-Based Authenticated Key Establishment Scheme for Future IoT Applications",
      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of all devices that can be accessed through the Internet. These devices can be remotely accessed and controlled using existing network infrastructure, thus allowing a direct integration of computing systems with the physical world. This also reduces human involvement along with improving accuracy and efficiency, resulting in economic benefit. The devices in IoT facilitate the day-to-day life of people. However, the IoT has an enormous threat to security and privacy due to its heterogeneous and dynamic nature. Authentication is one of the most challenging security requirements in the IoT environment, where a user (external party) can directly access information from the devices, provided the mutual authentication between user and devices happens. In this paper, we present a new signature-based authenticated key establishment scheme for the IoT environment. The proposed scheme is tested for security with the help of the widely used Burrows-Abadi\u2013Needham logic, informal security analysis, and also the formal security verification using the broadly accepted automated validation of Internet security protocols and applications tool. The proposed scheme is also implemented using the widely accepted NS2 simulator, and the simulation results demonstrate the practicability of the scheme. Finally, the proposed scheme provides more functionality features, and its computational and communication costs are also comparable with other existing approaches.",

      "abstract": "Due to the fast increase of sensing data and quick response requirement in the Internet of Things (IoT) delivery network, the high speed transmission has emerged as an important issue. Assigning suitable channels in the wireless IoT delivery network is a basic guarantee of high speed transmission. However, the high dynamics of traffic load (TL) make the conventional fixed channel assignment algorithm ineffective. Recently, the software defined networking-based IoT (SDN-IoT) is proposed to improve the transmission quality. Besides this, the intelligent technique of deep learning is widely researched in high computational SDN. Hence, we first propose a novel deep learning-based TL prediction algorithm to forecast future TL and congestion in network. Then, a deep learning-based partially channel assignment algorithm is proposed to intelligently allocate channels to each link in the SDN-IoT network. Finally, we consider a deep learning-based prediction and partially overlapping channel assignment to propose a novel intelligent channel assignment algorithm, which can intelligently avoid potential congestion and quickly assign suitable channels in SDN-IoT. The simulation result demonstrates that our proposal significantly outperforms conventional channel assignment algorithms.",

      "title": "FogFlow: Easy Programming of IoT Services Over Cloud and Edges for Smart Cities",
      "abstract": "Smart city infrastructure is forming a large scale Internet of Things (IoT) system with widely deployed IoT devices, such as sensors and actuators that generate a huge volume of data. Given this large scale and geo-distributed nature of such IoT systems, fog computing has been considered as an affordable and sustainable computing paradigm to enable smart city IoT services. However, it is still a major challenge for developers to program their services to leverage benefits of fog computing. Developers have to figure out many details, such as how to dynamically configure and manage data processing tasks over cloud and edges and how to optimize task allocation for minimal latency and bandwidth consumption. In addition, most of the existing fog computing frameworks either lack service programming models or define a programming model only based on their own private data model and interfaces; therefore, as a smart city platform, they are quite limited in terms of openness and interoperability. To tackle these problems, we propose a standard-based approach to design and implement a new fog computing-based framework, namely FogFlow, for IoT smart city platforms. FogFlow\u2019s programming model allows IoT service developers to program elastic IoT services easily over cloud and edges. Moreover, it supports standard interfaces to share and reuse contextual data across services. To showcase how smart city use cases can be realized with FogFlow, we describe three use cases and implement an example application for anomaly detection of energy consumption in smart cities. We also analyze FogFlow\u2019s performance based on microbenchmarking results for message propagation latency, throughput, and scalability.",

The IoT framework aspires to connect anyone with anything at anywhere. IoT typically has a three layers architecture consisting of Perception, Network, and Application layers. A number of security principles should be enforced at each layer to achieve a secure IoT realization. The future of IoT framework can only be ensured if the security issues associated with it are addressed and resolved. Many researchers have attempted to address the security concerns specific to IoT layers and devices by implementing corresponding countermeasures. This paper presents an overview of security principles, technological and security challenges, proposed countermeasures, and the future directions for securing the IoT.",

We cover the key components of interest to potential developers and users: the kernel, hardware abstraction, and software modularity, both conceptually and in practice for various example configurations. We explain operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and the use of networking. Finally, the relevant APIs as exposed by the OS are discussed along with the larger ecosystem around RIOT, including development and open source community aspects.",

Yet existing IoT platforms cannot evaluate whether an IoT app or environment is safe, secure, and operates correctly. In this paper, we present Soteria, a static analysis system for validating whether an IoT app or IoT environment (collection of apps working in concert) adheres to identified safety, security, and functional properties. Soteria operates in three phases; (a) translation of platform-specific IoT source code into an intermediate representation (IR), (b) extracting a state model from the IR, (c) applying model checking to verify desired properties. We evaluate Soteria on 65 SmartThings market apps through 35 properties and find nine (14%) individual apps violate ten (29%) properties. Further, our study of combined app environments uncovered eleven property violations not exhibited in the isolated apps. Lastly, we demonstrate Soteria on MalIoT, a novel open-source test suite containing 17 apps with 20 unique violations.",

      "abstract": "Empowered by computing resources at the network edge, data sensed from Internet of Things (IoT) devices can be processed and stored in their nearby cloudlets to reduce the traffic load in the core network, while various IoT applications can be run in cloudlets to reduce the response time between IoT users (e.g., user equipment in mobile networks) and cloudlets. Considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of each application\u2019s workloads among cloudlets, the workload allocation among cloudlets for each IoT application affects the response time of the application\u2019s requests. While assigning IoT users\u2019 requests to their nearby cloudlets can minimize the network delay, the computing delay of a type of requests may be unbearable if the corresponding virtual machine of the application in a cloudlet is overloaded. To solve this problem, we design an application aware workload allocation scheme for edge computing-based IoT to minimize the response time of IoT application requests by deciding the destination cloudlets for each IoT user\u2019s different types of requests and the amount of computing resources allocated for each application in each cloudlet. In this scheme, both the network delay and computing delay are taken into account, i.e., IoT users\u2019 requests are more likely assigned to closer and lightly loaded cloudlets. Meanwhile, the scheme will dynamically adjust computing resources of different applications in each cloudlet based on their workloads, thus reducing the computing delay of all requests in the cloudlet. The performance of the proposed scheme has been validated by extensive simulations.",

SainT operates in three phases; (a) translation of platform-specific IoT source code into an intermediate representation (IR), (b) identifying sensitive sources and sinks, and (c) performing static analysis to identify sensitive data flows. We evaluate SainT on 230 SmartThings market apps and find 138 (60%) include sensitive data flows. In addition, we demonstrate SainT on IoTBench, a novel open-source test suite containing 19 apps with 27 unique data leaks. Through this effort, we introduce a rigorously grounded framework for evaluating the use of sensitive information in IoT apps---and therein provide developers, markets, and consumers a means of identifying potential threats to security and privacy.",

Real-time analytics on the massive IoT data, referred to as the \u201creal-time IoT analytics\u201d in this paper, is becoming the mainstream with an aim to provide an immediate or non-immediate actionable insights and business intelligence. However, the analytics network of the existing IoT systems does not adequately consider the requirements of the real-time IoT analytics. In fact, most researchers overlooked an appropriate design of the IoT analytics network while focusing much on the sensing and delivery networks of the IoT system. Since much of the IoT analytics network has often been taken as granted, the survey, in this paper, we aim to review the state-of-the-art of the analytics network methodologies, which are suitable for real-time IoT analytics. In this vein, we first describe the basics of the real-time IoT analytics, use cases, and software platforms, and then explain the shortcomings of the network methodologies to support them. To address those shortcomings, we then discuss the relevant network methodologies which may support the real-time IoT analytics. Also, we present a number of prospective research problems and future research directions focusing on the network methodologies for the real-time IoT analytics.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a software-defined wireless sensor network architecture (Soft-WSN )\u2014an effort to support application-aware service provisioning in Internet of Things (IoT). Detailed architecture of the proposed system is presented involving the application, control, and infrastructure layers to enable software-defined networking (SDN) in IoT. We design a software-defined controller, which includes two management policies\u2014device management and network management. Device management facilitates users to control their devices in the network. To enable device control mechanisms, we investigate three scheduling issues in a sensor node\u2014sensing task, sensing delay, and active sleep. On the other hand, the topology of the network is controlled by the network management policies, which can be modified in run time to deal with dynamic requirements of IoT. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is implemented in a real hardware platform without changing the underlying sensor networking concepts, so that existing sensor devices can be seamlessly integrated. Therefore, in contrast to the existing SDN solutions for WSNs, the proposed system, Soft-WSN, focuses on both device management and topology management to meet run-time application-specific requirements of IoT, while enhancing flexibility and simplicity of WSN management. Experimental results on a real hardware-based test bed indicate that the proposed scheme is beneficial to meet real-time application-specific requirements of IoT, while ensuring significant improvements on network performance over the traditional approaches.",

      "abstract": "One of the goals of smart environments is to improve the quality of human life in terms of comfort and efficiency. The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has recently evolved into a technology for building smart environments. Security and privacy are considered key issues in any real-world smart environment based on the IoT model. The security vulnerabilities in IoT-based systems create security threats that affect smart environment applications. Thus, there is a crucial need for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) designed for IoT environments to mitigate IoT-related security attacks that exploit some of these security vulnerabilities. Due to the limited computing and storage capabilities of IoT devices and the specific protocols used, conventional IDSs may not be an option for IoT environments. This article presents a comprehensive survey of the latest IDSs designed for the IoT model, with a focus on the corresponding methods, features, and mechanisms. This article also provides deep insight into the IoT architecture, emerging security vulnerabilities, and their relation to the layers of the IoT architecture. This work demonstrates that despite previous studies regarding the design and implementation of IDSs for the IoT paradigm, developing efficient, reliable and robust IDSs for IoT-based smart environments is still a crucial task. Key considerations for the development of such IDSs are introduced as a future outlook at the end of this survey.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is set to become one of the key technological developments of our times provided we are able to realize its full potential. The number of objects connected to IoT is expected to reach 50 billion by 2020 due to the massive influx of diverse objects emerging progressively. IoT, hence, is expected to be a major producer of big data. Sharing and collaboration of data and other resources would be the key for enabling sustainable ubiquitous environments, such as smart cities and societies. A timely fusion and analysis of big data, acquired from IoT and other sources, to enable highly efficient, reliable, and accurate decision making and management of ubiquitous environments would be a grand future challenge. Computational intelligence would play a key role in this challenge. A number of surveys exist on data fusion. However, these are mainly focused on specific application areas or classifications. The aim of this paper is to review literature on data fusion for IoT with a particular focus on mathematical methods (including probabilistic methods, artificial intelligence, and theory of belief) and specific IoT environments (distributed, heterogeneous, nonlinear, and object tracking environments). The opportunities and challenges for each of the mathematical methods and environments are given. Future developments, including emerging areas that would intrinsically benefit from data fusion and IoT, autonomous vehicles, deep learning for data fusion, and smart cities, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of Internet of things (IoT) technology makes it possible for connecting various smart objects together through the Internet and providing more data interoperability methods for application purpose. Recent research shows more potential applications of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare services. However, the diversity of the objects in IoT causes the heterogeneity problem of the data format in IoT platform. Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing platform.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is an extension of the traditional Internet, which allows a very large number of smart devices, such as home appliances, network cameras, sensors and controllers to connect to one another to share information and improve user experiences. IoT devices are micro-computers for domain-specific computations rather than traditional functionspecific embedded devices. This opens the possibility of seeing many kinds of existing attacks, traditionally targeted at the Internet, also directed at IoT devices. As shown by recent events, such as the Mirai and Brickerbot botnets, DDoS attacks have become very common in IoT environments as these lack basic security monitoring and protection mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel light-weight approach for detecting DDos malware in IoT environments. We extract the malware images (i.e., a one-channel gray-scale image converted from a malware binary) and utilize a light-weight convolutional neural network for classifying their families. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve 94:0% accuracy for the classification of goodware and DDoS malware, and 81:8% accuracy for the classification of goodware and two main malware families.",

      "abstract": "Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin, can prove to be essential towards realizing the vision of a decentralized, secure, and open Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. There is a growing interest in many research groups towards leveraging blockchains to provide IoT data privacy without the need for a centralized data access model. This paper aims to propose a decentralized access model for IoT data, using a network architecture that we call a modular consortium architecture for IoT and blockchains. The proposed architecture facilitates IoT communications on top of a software stack of blockchains and peer-to-peer data storage mechanisms. The architecture is aimed to have privacy built into it, and to be adaptable for various IoT use cases. To understand the feasibility and deployment considerations for implementing the proposed architecture, we conduct performance analysis of existing blockchain development platforms, Ethereum and Monax.",

      "abstract": "With the evolving IoT scenario, computing has spread to the most minuscule everyday activities, leading to a momentous shift in the way applications are developed and deployed. With the volume of impact increasing exponentially, a coherent approach of deploying these applications is critical for an efficient utilization of the network infrastructure. A typical IoT application consists of various modules running together with active interdependencies; traditionally running on the Cloud hosted in global data centres. In this paper, we present a Module Mapping Algorithm for efficient utilization of resources in the network infrastructure by efficiently deploying Application Modules in Fog-Cloud Infrastructure for IoT based applications. With Fog computing into picture, computation is dynamically distributed across the Fog and Cloud layer, and the modules of an application can thus be deployed closer to the source on devices in the Fog layer. The result of this work can serve as a Micro-benchmark in studies/research related with IoT and Fog Computing, and can be used for Quality of Service (QoS) and Service Level Objective benchmarking for IoT applications. The approach is generic, and applies to a wide range of standardized IoT applications over varied network topologies irrespective of load.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) leads to an ever-growing presence of ubiquitous networked computing devices in public, business, and private spaces. These devices do not simply act as sensors, but feature computational, storage, and networking resources. Being located at the edge of the network, these resources can be exploited to execute IoT applications in a distributed manner. This concept is known as fog computing. While the theoretical foundations of fog computing are already established, there is a lack of resource provisioning approaches to enable the exploitation of fog-based computational resources. To resolve this shortcoming, we present a conceptual fog computing framework. Then, we model the service placement problem for IoT applications over fog resources as an optimization problem, which explicitly considers the heterogeneity of applications and resources in terms of Quality of Service attributes. Finally, we propose a genetic algorithm as a problem resolution heuristic and show, through experiments, that the service execution can achieve a reduction of network communication delays when the genetic algorithm is used, and a better utilization of fog resources when the exact optimization method is applied.",

As the IoT is now becoming a far more common field, the demand for IoT technologies to manage the communication of devices with the rest of the world has increased. The IoT is connecting various individual devices called things and wireless sensor networks is also playing an important role. A thing can be defined as an embedded device based on a micro controller that can transmit and receive information. These devices are extremely low in power, memory, and resources. Therefore, the research community has recognized the importance of IoT device operating systems (OSs). An adequate OS with a kernel, networking, real-time capability, and more can make these devices flexible. This review provides a detailed comparison of the OSs designed for IoT devices on the basis of their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models, power and memory management methods, together with other features required for IoT applications. In addition, various applications, challenges, and case studies in the field of IoT research is discussed.",

      "abstract": "The widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT), especially smart wearables, will play an important role in improving the quality of medical care, bringing convenience for patients and improving the management level of hospitals. However, due to the limitation of communication protocols, there exists non unified architecture that can connect all intelligent things in smart hospitals, which is made possible by the emergence of the Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). In light of this, we propose an architecture to connect intelligent things in smart hospitals based on NB-IoT, and introduce edge computing to deal with the requirement of latency in medical process. As a case study, we develop an infusion monitoring system to monitor the real-time drop rate and the volume of remaining drug during the intravenous infusion. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future directions for building a smart hospital by connecting intelligent things.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things is a novel paradigm with access to wireless communication systems and artificial intelligence technologies, which is considered to be applicable to a variety of promising fields and applications. Meanwhile, the development of the fifth-generation cellular network technologies creates the possibility to deploy enormous sensors in the framework of the IoT and to process massive data, challenging the technologies of communications and data mining. In this article, we propose a novel paradigm, 5G Intelligent Internet of Things (5G I-IoT), to process big data intelligently and optimize communication channels. First, we articulate the concept of the 5G I-IoT and introduce three major components of the 5G I-IoT. Then we expound the interaction among these components and introduce the key methods and techniques based on our proposed paradigm, including big data mining, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. In addition, an experimental result evaluates the performance of 5G I-IoT, and the effective utilization of channels and QoS have been greatly improved. Finally, several application fields and open issues are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Today, the Internet of Things (IoT) comprises vertically oriented platforms for things. Developers who want to use them need to negotiate access individually and adapt to the platform-specific API and information models. Having to perform these actions for each platform often outweighs the possible gains from adapting applications to multiple platforms. This fragmentation of the IoT and the missing interoperability result in high entry barriers for developers and prevent the emergence of broadly accepted IoT ecosystems. The BIG IoT (Bridging the Interoperability Gap of the IoT) project aims to ignite an IoT ecosystem as part of the European Platforms Initiative. As part of the project, researchers have devised an IoT ecosystem architecture. It employs five interoperability patterns that enable cross-platform interoperability and can help establish successful IoT ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of things (IoT) is still in its infancy and has attracted much interest in many industrial sectors including medical fields, logistics tracking, smart cities and automobiles. However as a paradigm, it is susceptible to a range of significant intrusion threats. This paper presents a threat analysis of the IoT and uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to combat these threats. A multi-level perceptron, a type of supervised ANN, is trained using internet packet traces, then is assessed on its ability to thwart Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS/DoS) attacks. This paper focuses on the classification of normal and threat patterns on an IoT Network. The ANN procedure is validated against a simulated IoT network. The experimental results demonstrate 99.4% accuracy and can successfully detect various DDoS/DoS attacks.",

      "abstract": "A future Internet of Things (IoT) system will connect the physical world into cyberspace everywhere and everything via billions of smart objects. On the one hand, IoT devices are physically connected via communication networks. The service oriented architecture (SOA) can provide interoperability among heterogeneous IoT devices in physical networks. On the other hand, IoT devices are virtually connected via social networks. In this paper we propose adaptive and scalable trust management to support service composition applications in SOA-based IoT systems. We develop a technique based on distributed collaborative filtering to select feedback using similarity rating of friendship, social contact, and community of interest relationships as the filter. Further we develop a novel adaptive filtering technique to determine the best way to combine direct trust and indirect trust dynamically to minimize convergence time and trust estimation bias in the presence of malicious nodes performing opportunistic service and collusion attacks. For scalability, we consider a design by which a capacity-limited node only keeps trust information of a subset of nodes of interest and performs minimum computation to update trust. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed trust management through service composition application scenarios with a comparative performance analysis against EigenTrust and PeerTrust.",

      "abstract": "Purpose \n \n \n \n \nThe Internet of Things (IoT) envisions a global infrastructure of networked physical objects that render radical transparency to supply chain management. Despite the perceived advantages of IoT, industry has still not widely adopted IoT-enabled logistics and supply chain management. The purpose of this paper is to understand the incentives and concerns behind firms\u2019 decisions to adopt IoT, explore the determinant factors affecting IoT adoption in logistics and supply chain management. \n \n \n \n \nDesign/methodology/approach \n \n \n \n \nThis study uses mixed methods research to explore the determinants of IoT adoption intention in logistics and supply chain management. Qualitative analysis using the Grounded Theory methodology reveals the underlying perceptions regarding logistic innovation with IoT. Quantitative hypotheses are then developed based on qualitative investigation and adoption literature. Survey data were collected from the managerial staff of Taiwanese firms across various industries. Structural equation modeling with partial least square is used for data analysis. \n \n \n \n \nFindings \n \n \n \n \nThe results of the qualitative study identify uncertainties and issues regarding firms\u2019 intention to accept or reject IoT technology in logistics and supply chain management, including the benefit and cost aspects of adopting IoT, uncertainties about the trustworthiness of IoT technology, and the external motivating force to embrace IoT. The resulting quantitative model shows that perceived benefits, perceived costs, and external pressure are significant determinants of IoT adoption intention, while technology trust is not. However, technology trust does indirectly influence IoT adoption intention through perceived benefits. \n \n \n \n \nPractical implications \n \n \n \n \nThe empirical findings of this study provide some guidelines for logistics and supply chain managers to evaluate IoT adoption in their firms. Likewise, IoT solution providers can also benefit from this study by improving their solutions to mitigate the IoT adoption concerns addressed herein. \n \n \n \n \nOriginality/value \n \n \n \n \nThis paper is among the first known to examine IoT adoption intention in logistics and supply chain management using mixed methods research. The mixed methods approach offers a better insight in understanding incentives behind firms\u2019 decisions to adopt IoT vs the use of either a qualitative or quantitative method alone.",

      "abstract": "In 3GPP, a narrowband system based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) is being introduced to support the Internet of Things. This system, named Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), can be deployed in three different operation modes - (1) stand-alone as a dedicated carrier, (2) in-band within the occupied bandwidth of a wideband LTE carrier, and (3) within the guard-band of an existing LTE carrier. In stand-alone operation mode, NB-IoT can occupy one GSM channel (200 kHz) while for in-band and guard-band operation modes, it will use one physical resource block of LTE (180 kHz). The design targets of NB-IoT include low-cost devices, high coverage (20-dB improvement over GPRS), long device battery life (more than 10 years), and massive capacity. Latency is relaxed although a delay budget of 10 seconds is the target for exception reports. The specifications for NB-IoT are expected to be finalized in 2016. In this paper, we describe the targets for NB-IoT and present a preliminary system design. In addition, coverage, capacity, latency, and battery life analysis are also presented.",

      "abstract": "These days, IoT devices are deployed at a massive scale, with Cisco predicting 20 billion devices by the year 2020. As opposed to endpoint devices, IoT devices are resource-constrained devices, incapable of securing and defending themselves, and can be easily hacked and compromised. Fog computing can augment such capacity limitations by providing localized compute, storage, and networking for a group of IoT devices. As fog nodes are deployed in close proximity to IoT devices, fog computing can be more effective than cloud computing. Furthermore, Blockchain has emerged as technology with capabilities to provide secure management, authentication and access to IoT devices and their data, in decentralized manner with high trust, integrity, and resiliency. In this paper, we propose a user authentication scheme using blockhain-enabled fog nodes in which fog nodes interface to Ethereum smart contracts to authenticate users to access IoT devices. The fog nodes are used to provide scalability to the system by relieving the IoT devices from carrying out heavy computation involving tasks related to authentication and communicating with the blockchain. We describe system components, architecture and design, and we discuss key aspects related to security analysis, functionality, testing and implementation of the smart contracts. The full code of the smart contracts for authentication registry, lists, rules and logic is also made publicly available at Github.",

      "abstract": "Recently, cloud manufacturing (CMfg) as a new service-oriented manufacturing mode has been paid wide attention around the world. However, one of the key technologies for implementing CMfg is how to realize manufacturing resource intelligent perception and access. In order to achieve intelligent perception and access of various manufacturing resources, the applications of IoT technologies in CMfg has been investigated in this paper. The classification of manufacturing resources and services, as well as their relationships, are presented. A five-layered structure (i.e., resource layer, perception layer, network layer, service layer, and application layer) resource intelligent perception and access system based on IoT is designed and presented. The key technologies for intelligent perception and access of various resources (i.e., hard manufacturing resources, computational resources, and intellectual resources) in CMfg are described. A prototype application system is developed to valid the proposed method.",

      "title": "Searching for the IoT Resources: Fundamentals, Requirements, Comprehensive Review, and Future Directions",
      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm links physical objects in the real world to cyber world and enables the creation of smart environments and applications. A physical object is the fundamental building block of the IoT, known as a Smart Device, that can monitor the environment. These devices can communicate with each other and have data processing abilities. When deployed, smart devices collect real-time data and publish the gathered data on the Web. The functionality of smart devices can be abstracted as a service and an IoT application can be built by combining the smart devices with these services that help to address challenges of day-to-day activities. The IoT comprises billions of these intelligent communicating devices that generate enormous amount of data, and hence performing analysis on this data is a significant task. Using search techniques, the size and extent of data can be reduced and limited, so that an application can choose just the most important and valuable data items as per its necessities. It is, however, a tedious task to effectively seek and select a proper device and/or its data among a large number of available devices for a specific application. Search techniques are fundamental to IoT and poses various challenges like a large number of devices, dynamic availability, restrictions on resource utilization, real time data in various types and formats, past and historical monitoring. In the recent past, various methods and techniques have been developed by the research community to address these issues. In this paper, we present a review of the state-of-the-art search methods for the IoT, classifying them according to their design principle and search approaches as: IoT data and IoT object-based techniques. Under each classification, we describe the method adopted, their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we identify and discuss key challenges and future research directions that will allow the next generation search techniques to recognize and respond to user queries and satisfy the information needs of users.",

Safety and health of workers are important for industrial workplace; therefore, an IoT network system which can monitor both environmental and physiological can greatly improve the safety in the workplace. The proposed network system incorporates multiple wearable sensors to monitor environmental and physiological parameters. The wearable sensors on different subjects can communicate with each other and transmit the data to a gateway via a LoRa network which forms a heterogeneous IoT platform with Bluetooth-based medical signal sensing network. Once harmful environments are detected and, the sensor node will provide an effective notification and warning mechanism for the users. A smart IoT gateway is implemented to provide data processing, local web server and cloud connection. After the gateway receives the data from wearable sensors, it will forward the data to an IoT cloud for further data storage, processing and visualization.",

      "abstract": "In this study, the authors focus on theoretical modelling of the fog computing\n architecture and compare its performance with the traditional cloud computing model. Existing research works on fog computing have primarily focused on the principles and concepts of fog computing and its significance in the context of internet of things\n (\n IoT\n). This work, one of the first attempts in its domain, proposes a mathematical formulation for this new computational paradigm by defining its individual components and presents a comparative study with cloud computing in terms of service latency and energy consumption. From the performance analysis, the work establishes fog computing, in collaboration with the traditional cloud computing platform, as an efficient green computing platform to support the demands of the next generation IoT applications. Results show that for a scenario where 25% of the IoT applications demand real-time, low-latency services, the mean energy expenditure in fog computing is 40.48% less than the conventional cloud computing model.",

      "abstract": "Often the Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as a single problem domain, with proposed solutions intended to be applied across a wide range of applications. However, the privacy and security needs of critical engineering infrastructure or sensitive commercial operations are very different to the needs of a domestic Smart Home environment. Additionally, the financial and human resources available to implement security and privacy vary greatly between application domains. In domestic environments, human issues may be as important as technical issues. After surveying existing solutions for enhancing IoT security, the paper identifies key future requirements for trusted Smart Home systems. A gateway architecture is selected as the most appropriate for resource-constrained devices, and for high system availability. Two key technologies to assist system auto-management are identified. Firstly, support for system auto-configuration will enhance system security. Secondly, the automatic update of system software and firmware is needed to maintain ongoing secure system operation.",

The more it will be included in our lifestyle, more will be the threat of it being misused. There is an urgent need to make IoT devices secure from getting cracked. Very soon IoT is going to expand the area for the cyber-attacks on homes and businesses by transforming objects that were used to be offline into online systems. Existing security technologies are just not enough to deal with this problem. Blockchain has emerged as the possible solution for creating more secure IoT systems in the time to come. In this paper, first an overview of the blockchain technology and its implementation has been explained; then we have discussed the infrastructure of IoT which is based on Blockchain network and at last a model has been provided for the security of internet of things using blockchain.",

      "abstract": "The current evolution of the traditional medical model toward the participatory medicine can be boosted by the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm involving sensors (environmental, wearable, and implanted) spread inside domestic environments with the purpose to monitor the user's health and activate remote assistance. RF identification (RFID) technology is now mature to provide part of the IoT physical layer for the personal healthcare in smart environments through low-cost, energy-autonomous, and disposable sensors. It is here presented a survey on the state-of-the-art of RFID for application to body centric systems and for gathering information (temperature, humidity, and other gases) about the user's living environment. Many available options are described up to the application level with some examples of RFID systems able to collect and process multichannel data about the human behavior in compliance with the power exposure and sanitary regulations. Open challenges and possible new research trends are finally discussed.",

      "title": "An IoT-cloud Based Wearable ECG Monitoring System for Smart Healthcare",
      "abstract": "Public healthcare has been paid an increasing attention given the exponential growth human population and medical expenses. It is well known that an effective health monitoring system can detect abnormalities of health conditions in time and make diagnoses according to the gleaned data. As a vital approach to diagnose heart diseases, ECG monitoring is widely studied and applied. However, nearly all existing portable ECG monitoring systems cannot work without a mobile application, which is responsible for data collection and display. In this paper, we propose a new method for ECG monitoring based on Internet-of-Things (IoT) techniques. ECG data are gathered using a wearable monitoring node and are transmitted directly to the IoT cloud using Wi-Fi. Both the HTTP and MQTT protocols are employed in the IoT cloud in order to provide visual and timely ECG data to users. Nearly all smart terminals with a web browser can acquire ECG data conveniently, which has greatly alleviated the cross-platform issue. Experiments are carried out on healthy volunteers in order to verify the reliability of the entire system. Experimental results reveal that the proposed system is reliable in collecting and displaying real-time ECG data, which can aid in the primary diagnosis of certain heart diseases.",

      "abstract": "In this article we propose a new paradigm of resource-efficient edge computing for the emerging intelligent IoT applications such as flying ad hoc networks for precision agriculture, e-health, and smart homes. We devise a resource-efficient edge computing scheme such that an intelligent IoT device user can well support its computationally intensive task by proper task offloading across the local device, nearby helper device, and the edge cloud in proximity. Different from existing studies for mobile computation offloading, we explore the novel perspective of resource efficiency and devise an efficient computation offloading mechanism consisting of a delay-aware task graph partition algorithm and an optimal virtual machine selection method in order to minimize an intelligent IoT device's edge resource occupancy and meanwhile satisfy its QoS requirement. Performance evaluation corroborates the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed resource-efficient edge computing scheme.",

      "abstract": "Cloud manufacturing (CM) and Internet of things (IoT) are interlinked, yet most works only focused on one of them and take the other as a constituent technology unit. This is practically inadequate, especially for a highly service-driven manufacturing execution system which entails systematical CM supports to respond to the real-time dynamics captured from the IoT-enabled execution hierarchy. To deal with the dynamics occurring in production logistics (PL) processes, this paper investigates a dynamic PL synchronization (PLS) of a manufacturer adopting public PL services. Contemporary CM and IoT infrastructures are systematically integrated to enable a smart PLS control mechanism with multi-level dynamic adaptability. The S-CM operation framework, operation logic, and PLS infrastructure are presented with an industrial case, and the effectiveness is also demonstrated and analyzed.",

      "abstract": "Recently, the Internet of Things (IoT) concept has attracted a lot of attention due to its capability to translate our physical world into a digital cyber world with meaningful information. The IoT devices are smaller in size, sheer in number, contain less memory, use less energy, and have more computational capabilities. These scarce resources for IoT devices are powered by small operating systems (OSs) that are specially designed to support the IoT devices\u2019 diverse applications and operational requirements. These IoT OSs are responsible for managing the constrained resources of IoT devices efficiently and in a timely manner. In this paper, discussions on IoT devices and OS resource management are provided. In detail, the resource management mechanisms of the state-of-the-art IoT OSs, such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS, are investigated. The different dimensions of their resource management approaches (including process management, memory management, energy management, communication management, and file management) are studied, and their advantages and limitations are highlighted.",

      "title": "BeeKeeper: A Blockchain-Based IoT System With Secure Storage and Homomorphic Computation",
      "abstract": "Currently, Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain technologies are experiencing exponential growth in academia and industry. Generally, IoT is a centralized system whose security and performance mainly rely on centralized servers. Therefore, users have to trust the centralized servers; in addition, it is difficult to coordinate external computing resources to improve the performance of IoT. Fortunately, the blockchain may provide this decentralization, high credibility and high security. Consequently, blockchain-based IoT may become a reasonable choice for the design of a decentralized IoT system. In this paper, we propose a novel blockchain-based threshold IoT service system: BeeKeeper. In the BeeKeeper system, servers can process a user\u2019s data by performing homomorphic computations on the data without learning anything from them. Furthermore, any node can become a leader\u2019s server if the node and the leader desire so. In this way, BeeKeeper\u2019s performance can continually increase by attracting external computing resources to join in it. Moreover, malicious nodes can be scrutinized. In addition, BeeKeeper is fault tolerant since a user\u2019s BeeKeeper protocol may work smoothly as long as a threshold number of its servers are active and honest. Finally, we deploy BeeKeeper on the Ethereum blockchain and give the corresponding performance evaluation. In our experiments, servers can generate their response with about 107 ms. Moreover, the performance of BeeKeeper mainly depends on the blockchain platform. For instance, the response time is about 22.5 s since the block interval of Ethereum blockchain is about 15 s. In fact, if we use some other blockchain with short block interval, the response time may be obviously short.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) demands a diverse and wide range of requirements in terms of latency, reliability, energy efficiency, etc. Future IoT systems must have the ability to deal with the challenging requirements of both users and applications. Cognitive fifth generation (5G) network is envisioned to play a key role in leveraging the performance of IoT systems. IoT systems in cognitive 5G network are expected to provide flexible delivery of broad services and robust operations under highly dynamic conditions. In this paper, we present multiband cooperative spectrum sensing and resource allocation framework for IoT in cognitive 5G networks. Multiband approach can significantly reduce energy consumption for spectrum sensing compared to the traditional single-band scheme. We formulate an optimization problem to determine a minimum number of channels to be sensed by each IoT node in multiband approach to minimize the energy consumption for spectrum sensing while satisfying probabilities of detection and false alarm requirements. We then propose a cross-layer reconfiguration scheme (CLRS) for dynamic resource allocation in IoT applications with different quality-of-service (QoS) requirements including data rate, latency, reliability, economic price, and environment cost. The potential game is employed for cross-layer reconfiguration, in which IoT nodes are considered as the players. The proposed CLRS efficiently allocate resources to satisfy QoS requirements through opportunistic spectrum access. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the benefits offered by the proposed framework for IoT systems.",

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) connects sensing devices to the Internet for the purpose of exchanging information. Location information is one of the most crucial pieces of information required to achieve intelligent and context-aware IoT systems. Recently, positioning and localization functions have been realized in a large amount of IoT systems. However, security and privacy threats related to positioning in IoT have not been sufficiently addressed so far. In this paper, we survey solutions for improving the robustness, security, and privacy of location-based services in IoT systems. First, we provide an in-depth evaluation of the threats and solutions related to both global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and non-GNSS-based solutions. Second, we describe certain cryptographic solutions for security and privacy of positioning and location-based services in IoT. Finally, we discuss the state-of-the-art of policy regulations regarding security of positioning solutions and legal instruments to location data privacy in detail. This survey paper addresses a broad range of security and privacy aspects in IoT-based positioning and localization from both technical and legal points of view and aims to give insight and recommendations for future IoT systems providing more robust, secure, and privacy-preserving location-based services.",

      "title": "Robustness, Security and Privacy in Location-Based Services for Future IoT: A Survey",
      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) connects sensing devices to the Internet for the purpose of exchanging information. Location information is one of the most crucial pieces of information required to achieve intelligent and context-aware IoT systems. Recently, positioning and localization functions have been realized in a large amount of IoT systems. However, security and privacy threats related to positioning in IoT have not been sufficiently addressed so far. In this paper, we survey solutions for improving the robustness, security, and privacy of location-based services in IoT systems. First, we provide an in-depth evaluation of the threats and solutions related to both global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and non-GNSS-based solutions. Second, we describe certain cryptographic solutions for security and privacy of positioning and location-based services in IoT. Finally, we discuss the state-of-the-art of policy regulations regarding security of positioning solutions and legal instruments to location data privacy in detail. This survey paper addresses a broad range of security and privacy aspects in IoT-based positioning and localization from both technical and legal points of view and aims to give insight and recommendations for future IoT systems providing more robust, secure, and privacy-preserving location-based services.",
